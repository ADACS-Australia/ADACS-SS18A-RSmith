 * compute.
 *
 * Be aware that for performance reasons the interpolating kernel is cached
 * and only recomputed if the error estimated to arise from failing to
 * recompute it exceeds the error estimated to arise from using a finite
 * interpolating kernel.  Therefore, if a function is interpolated at very
 * high resolution with a short kernel the result will consist of intervals
 * of constant values in a stair-step pattern.  The stair steps should be a
 * small contribution to the interpolation error but numerical
 * differentiation of the result is likely to be unsatisfactory.  In that
 * case, consider interpolating the derivative or use a longer kernel to
 * force more frequent kernel updates.

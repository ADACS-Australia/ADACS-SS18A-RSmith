This is version 0.7 of the LAL library.

Read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

The INSTALL file also includes instructions for compiling the documentation.
Once compiled, the documentation will be in the file doc/lsd.dvi or

This code requires the FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) package.
This package can be obtained from http://www.fftw.org

The latest releases of LAL are available from the LAL web-site:
http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/lal

The current working version of LAL can be obtained from the LAL CVS server by
issuing the commands:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/cvs/lal login

(the password is lal)

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/cvs/lal checkout lal
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/cvs/lal logout
  cd lal
  ./00boot

(you will need m4, aclocal, autoheader, automake, and autoconf).

The file README.contrib gives instructions for including a package in LAL.

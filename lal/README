The LAL website http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/lal contains detailed
installation instructions.  Generic instructions can be found in the INSTALL
file.  Specific instructions can be found in the README.install file.  If this
file is missing (you have a fresh checkout from CVS), it can be followed
with the instructions at the bottom of this document.


The latest releases of LAL are available from the LAL web-site:
http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/lal


The current working version of LAL can be obtained from the LAL CVS server by
issuing the commands:

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:2402/usr/local/cvs/lscsoft login

(the password is lal)

  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:2402/usr/local/cvs/lscsoft checkout lal
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:2402/usr/local/cvs/lscsoft logout
  cd lal
  ./00boot

you will need the proper versions of m4, aclocal, autoheader, automake,
and autoconf.

Specific install instructions can now be found in the README.install file.



There are two LAL mail lists/archives.  These are:

  LAL-Announce: general LAL announcements including release announcements.
  http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/lal-announce

  LAL-Discuss: general LAL discussion forum (but *not* for filing bug reports)
  http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/mailman/listinfo.cgi/lal-discuss



The file README.bugs gives instructions for filing bug reports for LAL.

The file README.contrib gives instructions for including a package in LAL.

The file README.install gives specific instructions for performing a basic
installation.  If this file is missing, it can be generated using the following
commands:

        sed -f doc/txtstrip.sed doc/lal-preinstall-x.sh > doc/lal-preinstall.txt
        sed -f doc/txtstrip.sed doc/lal-install-x.sh > doc/lal-install.txt
        m4 doc/install.m4 > README.install

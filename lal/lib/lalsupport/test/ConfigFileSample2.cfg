## Some 'tough' tests for config-file reading routines
# comment line
[section1]
float1 = 1.0 ; ## semi-colons can be used to separate assignments, otherwise ignored

string1 = some text.\
	You can also use\
	line-continuation

   int1 = 4      # whatever that means

# Comment before section
[section2]
# Comment after section
string2 = "this is also possible, and # here does nothing; and neither does semi-colon ";	# but this is a comment

[section3]
string3 = "how about #quotes\
	AND line-continuation?"		# yet another comment
testBool = False	# use yes/no/0/1/true/false, case INsensitive
# etc etc.

 * \brief Provides routines to read data from an open stream and store it in LAL data structures.
 *
 * ### Synopsis ###
 *
 * \code
 * #include "StreamInput.h"
 * \endcode
 *
 * This header provides prototypes for routines that construct
 * LAL data structures using the data from a file (or other I/O) stream.
 * The routines do not provide a system-level interface to create files
 * and open or close file streams; they simply assume that they have been
 * passed an open, readable stream.  Nonetheless, because they involve
 * I/O stream manipulation, these routines are placed in the
 * \c lalsupport library rather than in \c lal proper.
 *
 * The routines in \ref StreamVectorInput_c and
 * \ref StreamVectorSequenceInput_c are compartmentalized in such a way
 * that they can easily be converted if the LAL specification later
 * changes the way in which I/O streams are handled.  In partucular, the
 * only file I/O commands used are <tt>fgets()</tt> and <tt>feof()</tt>.
 * Thus the upgrade would involve only the following global changes:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Replace all occurrences of <tt>FILE *</tt> with the name of the
 * LAL I/O stream pointer type.</li>
 * <li> Replace all occurrences of <tt>fgets()</tt> and <tt>feof()</tt> with
 * equivalent LAL functions.</li>
 * </ol>
 * In particular, there is no need to translate routines such as
 * <tt>fscanf()</tt>; one should simply read data into a LAL
 * \c CHARVector and then use <tt>sscanf()</tt> to format the input.
 * This is the approach used in the numerical input routines in
 * \ref StreamVectorInput_c and \ref StreamVectorSequenceInput_c.
 *
 * The routines in \ref StreamSequenceInput_c are less robust but much
 * more efficient: they use <tt>fscanf()</tt> to parse the input stream
 * directly.  They are intended primarily for test programs that may need
 * to read large datafiles of undetermined length.  The routines in
 * \ref StreamSeriesInput_c and \ref StreamGridInput_c also parse the
 * input stream directly using <tt>fscanf()</tt>, to avoid potentially
 * crippling computational overhead.

 *
 * \brief Reads data from a single line in an input stream.
 *
 * ### Description ###
 *
 * These routines read ASCII data from the I/O stream <tt>*stream</tt>
 * until a newline or the end-of-input is reached.  (The line can be of
 * arbitrary length; the data is temporarily stored in a linked list of
 * buffers.)  Once read, a LAL vector structure <tt>**vector</tt> is
 * created and the data stored in it.  The routine passes back a pointer
 * to the new structure.  For the numerical routines, the \c strict
 * parameter determines whether the routine will do strict error checking
 * based on the contents of the input stream (see below).
 *
 * The basic routine in this module is <tt>LALCHARReadVector()</tt>, which
 * simply stores bytes read from <tt>*stream</tt> until the next newline
 * character <tt>'\n'</tt>, null character <tt>'\0'</tt>, or the end of the
 * input as determined by the <tt>feof()</tt> function.  The vector
 * includes the newline (if present), and also an explicit <tt>'\0'</tt> at
 * the end, if one was not already present.  This routine should
 * \e not be used to read a binary data stream, which are not
 * logically divided into ``lines''.  Unless it aborts due to invalid
 * arguments or failed memory allocation, <tt>LALCHARReadVector()</tt> will
 * always return successfully regardless of the contents of the input
 * stream; <tt>*vector</tt> will created containing at least a single
 * <tt>'\0'</tt> terminator, if nothing else.
 *
 * The other routines in this module use <tt>LALCHARReadVector()</tt> to
 * read a line, and then parse it into numerical datatypes using the
 * corresponding routine in the \ref StringConvert.c.
 * Conversion stops when the routine encounters a character that cannot
 * be parsed as part of a number.  If \c strict is 0, the routine
 * will fail only due to invalid arguments or memory allocation failure,
 * not from a poorly-formatted input stream; if no numbers are read,
 * <tt>*vector</tt> will remain \c NULL, but no error will be reported.
 * (In this mode, the calling routine should always test the output
 * before trying to dereference it, in order to avoid segmentation
 * violations.)  If \c strict is nonzero, the routine will report an
 * error if the input stream was poorly formatted, either an \c ELEN
 * error if no numbers were read, or \c EFMT if a character was
 * encountered that was neither part of a parseable number nor
 * whitespace.
 *
 * Note that \c strict=0 allows an input stream to contain blank
 * lines or comments.  A comment begins with any character that cannot
 * occur in a valid number, which will cause the numerical parser to skip
 * the rest of the line.  The usual comment delimiters are <tt>'#'</tt> and
 * <tt>'%'</tt>, but any character except <tt>'+'</tt> <tt>'-'</tt>,
 * <tt>'e'</tt>, <tt>'E'</tt>, <tt>'.'</tt>, digits, and whitespace will work.

 * \author Creighton, T. D.
 *
 * \brief Reads the entire contents of an input stream into a vector sequence.
 *
 * ### Description ###
 *
 * These routines read data from the I/O stream <tt>*stream</tt> until the
 * end-of-input is reached.  Each line is stored as a data vector, and
 * the vectors are combined into a LAL vector sequence structure
 * <tt>**sequence</tt>.  Each line vector is padded with zeros to match the
 * length of the longest line.  The routine passes back a pointer to the
 * new structure.
 *
 * The routine <tt>LALCHARReadVectorSequence()</tt> essentially stores an
 * image of the I/O stream as a sequence of lines padded with <tt>'\0'</tt>
 * characters.  However, it will skip over any empty lines, which occur,
 * for instance, when the end-of-input or a null character <tt>'\0'</tt>
 * occurs immediately following a newline character <tt>'\n'</tt>.  The
 * numeric routines will additionally skip blank lines, comment lines, or
 * other input lines that have no parseable numbers in them.  (As with
 * the routines in \ref StreamVectorInput.c, comment in sindicated by a
 * <tt>#</tt> sign at the beginning of a line or a <tt>%</tt> sign anywhere
 * in the line, signifying that the remainder of the line is to be
 * ignored.)  However, if an input line contains \e any parseable
 * data, then the corresponding vector in the vector sequence will be
 * allocated (and padded with zeros, if it is shorter than the longest
 * line).
 *
 * ### Algorithm ###
 *
 * These functions first create a linked list of vectors, using the
 * routines in \ref StreamVectorInput.c to read them in.  Once the list
 * is complete, the longest vector length is determined, and the vector
 * sequence is created and filled.
 *
 * The numeric routines skip over blank, comment, or otherwise
 * unparseable lines by catching and handling the \c LEN error code
 * generated by the vector input routine.  However, it is worth pointing
 * out that the vector input routine will have generated an error message
 * if the error reporting bit in \c lalDebugLevel was set.  The
 * vector sequence input routines will therefore generate a followup
 * messages indicating that the preceding error was successfully dealt
 * with.  So you may see pairs of \c ABORT: and \c CONTINUE:
 * error messages when reading files containing blank or comment lines.

 *
 * \brief Converts an input stream into a data sequence.
 *
 * ### Description ###
 *
 * These routines read data from the I/O stream <tt>*stream</tt> until the
 * end-of-input is reached.  (The input can be of arbitrary length; the
 * data is temporarily stored in a linked list of buffers.)  Once read, a
 * LAL sequence structure <tt>**sequence</tt> is created and the data
 * stored in it.  The routine passes back a pointer to the new structure.
 *
 * The routine <tt>LALCHARReadSequence()</tt> simply stores the entire
 * remaining contents of the I/O stream in a \c CHARSequence,
 * including whitespace, newline <tt>'\n'</tt>, null <tt>'\0'</tt>, or other
 * special characters.  (It can in principle be used to read and store
 * binary data as a sequence of bytes.  Note that the end-of-transmission
 * byte <tt>'\004'</tt> does \e not necessarily mark the end-of-input,
 * which is instead determined using the <tt>feof()</tt> function.)
 *
 * The other routines in this module interpret the input as a sequence of
 * whitespace-separated numbers, which are parsed directly from the I/O
 * stream using <tt>fscanf()</tt>.  The sequence is terminated at the
 * end-of-input or at any point where <tt>fscanf()</tt> is unable to parse
 * the input.
 *
 * For the complex input routines <tt>LALCReadSequence()</tt> and
 * <tt>LALZReadSequence()</tt>, each pair of numbers read are interpreted
 * as the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.  The usual input
 * format is for each line to contain a pair of numbers, but
 * <tt>fscanf()</tt> does not distinguish between newline and other
 * whitespace characters, so neither do these routines.
 *
 * Unlike the numerical routines in other \ref StreamInput.h modules,
 * these routines have no mechanism to deal with comments; every
 * whitespace-delimited substring will be treated as a number.
 *
 * ### Algorithm ###
 *
 * These routines read data into a linked list of buffers, to allow
 * memory allocation to occur in batches for improved efficiency.  The
 * numerical routines also use <tt>fscanf()</tt> directly on the I/O stream
 * to avoid the inefficiency of storing and parsing intermediate
 * character strings, as is done by the corresponding vector sequence
 * input routines.  This reduces robustness and versatility (as
 * indicated, for instance, by the inability of dealing with comments),
 * and increases the number of potential points-of-failure (by requiring
 * a consistent implementation across platforms of <tt>getc()</tt> and
 * <tt>fscanf()</tt>, rather than the single function <tt>fgets()</tt> used
 * by other stream input routines).  However, these sacrifices are
 * necessary to allow LAL applications to ingest large quantities of
 * numerical data efficiently.

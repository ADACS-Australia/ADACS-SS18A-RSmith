A general spatial coordinate system is shown in Fig.1.
It is defined by six parameters: three
positions specifying the location of the origin \f$O\f$, two angles
specifying the direction of the <em>pole</em> or \f$z\f$-axis, and one
further angle specifying a <em>reference meridian</em> or \f$x\f$-axis
orthogonal to the \f$z\f$-axis.  A \f$y\f$-axis can also be defined such that
\f$x\f$, \f$y\f$, and \f$z\f$ form an orthogonal right-handed coordinate system;
however, in astronomy it is more conventional to use spherical
coordinates, defined as follows:

For any given point \f$P\f$, define a plane (called its meridian)
containing both the \f$z\f$-axis and the point in question.  The
<em>longitude</em> \f$\lambda\f$ is the angle in the \f$x\f$-\f$y\f$ plane from the
\f$x\f$-axis to the line where the object's meridian crosses the \f$x-y\f$
plane.  The <em>latitude</em> \f$\phi\f$ is the angle in the meridian plane
between this line and the direction to the object.  The
<em>distance</em> \f$r\f$ is simply measured in a straight line from the
origin to the point.  Longitude is defined to increase in the
right-handed direction about the \f$z\f$-axis (i.e. the \f$y\f$-axis lies at
<em>positive</em> \f$\pi/2\f$ radians longitude), and is typically given in
the range \f$[0,2\pi)\f$ radians.  Latitude is defined to increase towards
the \f$z\f$-axis (i.e. the \f$z\f$-axis lies at <em>positive</em>
\f$\pi/2\f$ radians latitude), and is typically given in the range
\f$[-\pi/2,\pi/2]\f$ radians; a point with latitude \f$\pm\pi/2\f$ radians has
arbitrary (undefined) longitude.  Distance should always be positive.
This convention is shown in Fig.1.

In the routines in this module, we do not perform transformations
between coordinate systems having different origins.  By default, all
coordinates are assumed to be centred on the observer; however, one
may also consider coordinate systems that are <em>geogentric</em>
(having their origin at the centre of the Earth), <em>heliocentric</em>
(origin at the centre of the Sun), <em>barycentric</em> (origin at the
centre of mass of the solar system), and <em>Galactocentric</em> (origin
at the centre of our Galaxy).  Since we ignore translations in the
coordinate origin, distances remain unchanged, so these routines only
consider transformations in latitude and longitude.  To put it another
way, these routines transform <em>directions</em> in space, not
<em>locations</em> in space.  These directions are generically stored in
the <tt>SkyPosition</tt> structure, defined below.

The coordinate systems that we consider are defined as follows:

This is a local coordinate system for
a particular observation point \f$O\f$ on the Earth, as shown in
Fig. 2.  The \f$z\f$-axis is defined to be the direction
opposite to the local acceleration due to gravity.  The \f$x\f$-axis is
defined to lie in the plane formed by the \f$z\f$-axis and the Earth's
rotational axis, and to be directed into the northern hemisphere.  In
this coordinate system, the latitude coordinate is called the
<em>altitude</em> and the longitude coordinate is the <em>negative</em> of
what astronomers call the <em>azimuth</em>; this sign reversal is due to
the fact that astronomers define azimuth to increase clockwise, and
our longitudinal coordinates uniformly increase counterclockwise about
the \f$z\f$-axis.
This coordinate system is related to the geographic coordinate system
(below) by the geographic latitude \f$\phi_z\f$ and longitude \f$\lambda_z\f$
of the observer's \f$z\f$-axis direction.

\textbf{Geographic coordinates:}

\image html inject_geographic.png "Fig.3: Definition of the geographic (Earth-fixed) coordinate system."
\htmlonly <b>Geographic coordinates:</b> \endhtmlonly
This is a planetwide Earth-fixed
coordinate system, shown in Fig.3.  The \f$z\f$-axis
is defined to be parallel to the Earth's axis, in the direction of the
Earth's north pole.  The \f$x\f$-axis is defined to be parallel to the
direction perpendicular from the Earth's rotation axis to a reference
point in Greenwich, UK (the <em>prime meridian</em>.  Note that we adopt
a longitude convention that is consistent with the
<i>Astronomical Almanac</i>, but opposite to that
in \ref Lang_K1999, in that our geographic longitudes increase
<em>eastward</em> (counterclockwise) like the rest of our longitudinal
coordinates.

The terms ``latitude'' and ``longitude'' without qualification
normally refer to geographic latitude and longitude.  However, we
emphasize once again that geographic latitude and longitude as defined
above refer to directions in space, not to locations on the Earth's
surface.  This can lead to some confusion.  The <em>geodetic</em>
latitude and longitude of a point on the Earth's surface are the
latitude and longitude of its vertical direction; this is the standard
meaning used by cartographers, and relates directly to the
horizon-based coordinate system above.  However, one can also define a
<em>geocentric</em> latitude and longitude for a point on the surface,
which are the latitude and longitude of the direction from the
geometric centre of the Earth through that point.  These angles are
not necessarily the same, due to the Earth's ellipticity, as shown in
Fig.3 in <tt>TerrestrialCoordinates.h</tt>.

Geographic coordinates are related to sky-fixed equatorial coordinates
by specifying the counterclockwise angle <em>to</em> the prime meridian
<em>from</em> the reference meridian \f$\Upsilon\f$ of the sky-fixed
coordinates, as defined below.  This angle is called the Greenwich
Mean Sidereal Time (GMST), and is often specified in hours, minutes,
and seconds.

\htmlonly <b>Equatorial coordinates:</b> \endhtmlonly
This is the standard sky-fixed coordinate system.  The \f$z\f$-axis is defined as for geographic
coordinates, above; the plane orthogonal to this passing through the
Earth's centre is called the <em>equator</em>.  The \f$x\f$-axis is defined
to be the direction, as viewed from the centre of the Earth, where the
Sun appears to cross the equator moving north in spring.  This is
called the <em>vernal equinox</em> \f$\Upsilon\f$, and is shown in
Fig.4.  In this coordinate system, the latitude coordinate is called the
<em>declination</em> \f$\delta\f$ and the longitude coordinate is called the
<em>right ascension</em> \f$\alpha\f$.

\htmlonly <b>Ecliptic coordinates:</b> \endhtmlonly
\latexonly \textbf{Ecliptic coordinates:}\endlatexonly
This is another sky-fixed coordinate
system, shown in Fig.4. The \f$z\f$-axis is defined to
be the direction orthogonal to the orbital plane of the Earth about
the Sun, directed such that the Earth orbits in a right-handed sense.
The \f$x\f$-axis is defined as for equatorial coordinates, above; we note
that by definition it lies parallel to the intersection of the
equatorial and orbital planes of the Earth.

The equatorial and ecliptic coordinate systems are related by a single
angle \f$\epsilon\f$, called the <em>obliquity of the ecliptic</em> (that
is, the inclination of the Earth's rotation axis relative to its
orbital axis).  Ecliptic latitude is normally denoted as \f$\beta\f$ and
ecliptic longitude as \f$\lambda\f$.

\textbf{Galactic coordinates:}
\endlatexonly
\image html inject_galactic.png "Fig.5: Definition of the Galactic coordinate system."
\htmlonly <b>Galactic coordinates:</b> \endhtmlonly
This coordinate system is shown in Fig.5.
The \f$z\f$-axis is defined to be the direction
orthogonal to the plane of our Galaxy and pointing into the northern
hemisphere of the equatorial coordinate system.  (Unfortunately this
convention has the unintuitive result that the physical rotation of
the Galaxy is left-handed about this axis.)  The \f$x\f$-axis is defined
to be the direction of the Galactic centre as viewed from the Earth.
The Galactic latitude coordinate is normally denoted as \f$b\f$ and the
Galactic longitude as \f$l\f$.

The definition of the Galactic coordinate system is completely
unrelated to any of the the other coordinate systems; thus, the
relationship between Galactic and equatorial coodinates requires one
to specify three arbitrary (but constant) angles.  Two of these are
the right ascension \f$\alpha_\mathrm{NGP}\f$ and declination
\f$\delta_\mathrm{NPG}\f$ of the North Galactic Pole (\f$z\f$-axis) in the
equatorial coordinate system, the third is the Galactic longitude
\f$l_\mathrm{ascend}\f$ of the point where the Galactic plane ascends
through the equatorial plane; i.e. the \f$l\f$ value for the direction
along the intersection of the Galactic and equatorial planes, such
that right-handed rotation about the Galactic \f$z\f$-axis moves you from
south to north through the equator.

   \defgroup inject Inject
   \ingroup coreDA

This package provides routines to simulate gravitational waves and
their effect on a detector.  Conceptually, this can be divided into
three stages:
<ol>
<li> Generating the gravitational waveform as produced by the source.
The routines currently available are:

  - GeneratePPNInspiral.h: Provides routines to generate
  parametrized post-Newtonian inspiral waveforms up to 5/2 order.
  - GenerateTaylorCW.h: Provides a routine to generate
  continuous quasiperiodic waveforms with Taylor-parametrized frequency
  evolution.
  - GenerateSpinOrbitCW.h:  Provides a routine to generate
  Taylor-parameterized waveforms, as above, with additional binary orbit
  Doppler modulations.


<li> Simulating a detector's theoretical response to an incoming
gravitational wave.  The routines currently available are:

   - SimulateCoherentGW.h: routines to simulate the
   detector response to a coherent wave with slowly-varying frequency and
   amplitude.
   - SimulateSB.h: Provides routines to simulate the
   response of a pair of detectors to a stochastic gravitational-wave
   background.

 <li> Injecting the detector's theoretical response with time into a
 (noisy) datastream.  This is done by a single set of generic routines
 in inject.h.
</ol>

As the package evolves, new source types may be added under item 1,
and other (perhaps more generic) ways of simulating the detector
response may be added under item 2.  Item 3, however, is unlikely to
need much updating.

In addition to these basic divisions, the package may include routines
that perform other useful tasks in signal injection or source
simulation, such as combining signal generation, detector simulation,
and injection into a single function call, or modelling astrophysical
distributions of sources.

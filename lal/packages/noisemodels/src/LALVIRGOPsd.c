\brief Module to calculate the noise power spectral density for the VIRGO detector.

\heading{Description}

The module takes as an input a frequency \f$f\f$ in Hz, and it
calculates the noise spectral density (per Hz) \f$S_{h}(f)\f$
for that frequency. The noise PSD is based on data provided by
J-Y. Vinet and is approximated by
the following:
\f{equation}{
   S_h(f) =
   s_0 \left ( \frac {7.87f}{f_0} \right )^{-4.8} + \frac{6}{17} \frac{f_0}{f}
   + \left [1 + \left (\frac {f}{f_0} \right)^2 \right ],
\f}
where \f$s_0=10.2e-46\f$

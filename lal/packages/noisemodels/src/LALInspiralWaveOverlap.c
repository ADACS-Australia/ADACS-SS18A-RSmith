\subsection{Module \texttt{LALInspiralWaveOverlap.c}}
Module to compute the overlap of a given data set with
two orthogonal inspiral signals of specified parameters 
with a weight specified in a psd array. The code also returns
in a parameter structure the maximum of the overlap, the bin
where the maximum occured and the phase at the maximum.

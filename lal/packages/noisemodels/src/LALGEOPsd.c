\brief Module to calculate the expected noise power spectral density for the GEO600 detector.

\heading{Description}

The module takes as an input a frequency \f$f\f$ in Hz, and it
calculates the noise spectral density (per Hz) \f$S_{h}(f)\f$
for that frequency. The noise PSD is based on data provided by
J. Hough and G. Cagnoli (see T. Damour, B.R. Iyer and B.S. Sathyaprakash,
Phys. Rev. D 63, 044023 (2001)) and is approximated by
the following:
\f{equation}{
   S_h(f) = 10^{-16} \left ( \frac{f}{f_0} \right)^{-30} +
            34 \frac{f_0 }{ f } +
   \frac{20 \left [1 - (f/f_0)^2 + 0.5 (f/f_0)^4 \right ] }{ 1 + 0.5 (f/f_0)^2}
\f}
The returned value is scaled up by \f$s_0 = 10^{46}.\f$ In otherwords,
the expected noise PSD is a factor \f$10^{46}\f$ lower.

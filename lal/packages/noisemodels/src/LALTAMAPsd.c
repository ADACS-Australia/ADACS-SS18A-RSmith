\subsection{Module \texttt{LALTAMAPsd.c}}

Module to calculate the noise power spectral density for the TAMA detector.

\subsubsection*{Description}

The module takes as an input a frequency $f$ in Hz, and it
calculates the noise spectral density (per Hz) $S_{h}(f)$
for that frequency. The noise PSD is based on data provided by
M.-K Fujimoto (see T. Damour, B.R. Iyer and B.S. Sathyaprakash,
Phys. Rev. D 63, 044023 (2001)) and is approximated by
the following:
\begin{equation}
   S_h(f) = \left ( \frac{f}{f_0} \right )^{-5} + 13 \frac{f_0}{f} +
   9 \left [1 + \left( \frac{f}{f_0} \right)^2 \right ].
\end{equation}
The returned value is scaled up by $s_0 = 10^{46}/75.$ In otherwords,
the expected noise PSD is $75 \times 10^{-46}$ times the returned value.
\subsubsection*{Algorithm}


\subsubsection*{Uses}
None.

 *
 * \brief XLAL routines for converting civil time structures to GPS times.
 *
 * Civil time structures, represented in the C library by the \c struct \c tm
 * structure, known as a broken down time structure, gives the time by normal
 * measures (hours, minutes, seconds since midnight, day of the month, month of
 * the year, and year).  LAL uses seconds since the the GPS epoch as its
 * reference.  The GPS epoch is defined to be 0h UTC 6 Jan 1980 in civil time.
 * The process of converting between a civil time and a GPS time is almost done
 * by standard C library functions, though the C library functions use a
 * different reference epoch, which is called the UNIX epoch.
 *
 * The tricky bits are:
 *   - What about time zones?
 *   - What about leap seconds?
 *
 * This code does not deal with time zones at all.  All civil time structures
 * are taken to be in Coordinated Universal Time or UTC.  The user must convert
 * local times into UTC before using these routines.
 *
 * Leap seconds are accounted for.  But since the addition and subtraction of
 * leap seconds is not deterministic, a leap second table needs to be
 * maintained to account for the number of leap seconds in effect at a
 * particular time.
 *
 * Leap seconds are defined as the difference between UTC and a (yet another)
 * standard of time called the International Atomic Time or TAI.  UTC is
 * ultimately determined by the position of the stars, so it is occationally
 * altered by a second to keep the location of fixed points on the celestial
 * sphere correct to within plus or minus 0.9 seconds.  TAI, like the GPS time
 * used in LAL, is just the number of seconds since some epoch and is not
 * affected by leap seconds.  The difference between TAI and UTC, TAI-UTC,
 * is the number of leap seconds.
 *
 * Note that UTC is fixed to atomic time, though there are an integer number
 * of leap seconds.  The real civil time, as measured in terms of points on
 * the celestial sphere, is UT1.  UTC and UT1 are kept within 0.9 seconds of
 * each other by the introduction of leap seconds.  But if what you want is
 * UT1 note that UTC can be off by up to about a seconds.  For this reason,
 * we assume that accuracy at the second scale is sufficient, so the routines
 * have only second precision.  If you need more accuracy, you'll need to be
 * monitoring UT1.
 *
 * Another way of representing the civil time in in terms of Julian days.
 * There is a routine for converting a UTC time into Julian days.
 * The inverse conversion is not attempted.
 *

/** Returns the Julian Day (JD) corresponding to the date given in a broken
 * down time structure.
 *
 * See \ref esaa1992 and \ref green1985 for details.  First, some
 * definitions:
 *
 * Mean Julian Year = 365.25 days
 * Julian Epoch = 1 Jan 4713BCE, 12:00 GMT (4713 BC Jan 01d.5 GMT)
 * Fundamental Epoch J2000.0 = 2001-01-01.5 TDB
 *
 * Julian Date is the amount of time elapsed since the Julian Epoch,
 * measured in days and fractions of a day.  There are a couple of
 * complications arising from the length of a year:  the Tropical Year is
 * 365.2422 days.  First, the Gregorian correction where 10 days
 * (1582-10-05 through 1582-10-14) were eliminated.  Second, leap years:
 * years ending with two zeroes (e.g., 1700, 1800) are leap only if
 * divisible by 400;  so, 400 civil years contain 400 * 365.25 - 3 = 146097
 * days.  So, the Julian Date of J2000.0 is JD 2451545.0, and thus the
 * Julian Epoch = J2000.0 + (JD - 2451545) / 365.25, i.e., number of years
 * elapsed since J2000.0.
 *
 * One algorithm for computing the Julian Day is from \ref vfp1979 based
 * on a formula in \ref esaa1992 where the algorithm is due to
 * \ref fvf1968 and ``compactified'' by P. M. Muller and R. N. Wimberly.
 * The formula is
 *
 * \f[
 * jd = 367 \times y - 7 \times (y + (m + 9)/12)/4 - 3 \times ((y + (m -
 * 9)/7)/100 + 1)/4 + 275 \times m/9 + d + 1721029
 * \f]
 *
 * where jd is the Julian day number, y is the year, m is the month (1-12),
 * and d is the day (1-31).  This formula is valid only for JD > 0, i.e.,
 * after -4713 Nov 23 = 4712 BCE Nov 23.
 *
 * A shorter formula from the same reference, but which only works for
 * dates since 1900 March is:
 *
 * \f[
 * jd = 367 \times y - 7 \times (y + (m + 9)/12)/4 + 275 \times m/9 + d +
 * 1721014
 * \f]
 *
 * We will use this shorter formula since there is unlikely to be any
 * analyzable data from before 1900 March.

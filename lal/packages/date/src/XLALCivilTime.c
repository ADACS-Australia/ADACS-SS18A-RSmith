 * \brief XLAL routines for converting civil time structures to GPS times.
 *
 * Civil time structures, represented in the C library by the \c struct \c tm
 * structure, known as a broken down time structure, gives the time by normal
 * measures (hours, minutes, seconds since midnight, day of the month, month of
 * the year, and year).  LAL uses seconds since the the GPS epoch as its
 * reference.  The GPS epoch is defined to be 0h UTC 6 Jan 1980 in civil time.
 * The process of converting between a civil time and a GPS time is almost done
 * by standard C library functions, though the C library functions use a
 * different reference epoch, which is called the UNIX epoch.
 *
 * The tricky bits are:
 *   - What about time zones?
 *   - What about leap seconds?
 *
 * This code does not deal with time zones at all.  All civil time structures
 * are taken to be in Coordinated Universal Time or UTC.  The user must convert
 * local times into UTC before using these routines.
 *
 * Leap seconds are accounted for.  But since the addition and subtraction of
 * leap seconds is not deterministic, a leap second table needs to be
 * maintained to account for the number of leap seconds in effect at a
 * particular time.
 *
 * Leap seconds are defined as the difference between UTC and a (yet another)
 * standard of time called the International Atomic Time or TAI.  UTC is
 * ultimately determined by the position of the stars, so it is occationally
 * altered by a second to keep the location of fixed points on the celestial
 * sphere correct to within plus or minus 0.9 seconds.  TAI, like the GPS time
 * used in LAL, is just the number of seconds since some epoch and is not
 * affected by leap seconds.  The difference between TAI and UTC, TAI-UTC,
 * is the number of leap seconds.
 *
 * Note that UTC is fixed to atomic time, though there are an integer number
 * of leap seconds.  The real civil time, as measured in terms of points on
 * the celestial sphere, is UT1.  UTC and UT1 are kept within 0.9 seconds of
 * each other by the introduction of leap seconds.  But if what you want is
 * UT1 note that UTC can be off by up to about a seconds.  For this reason,
 * we assume that accuracy at the second scale is sufficient, so the routines
 * have only second precision.  If you need more accuracy, you'll need to be
 * monitoring UT1.
 *
 * Another way of representing the civil time in in terms of Julian days.
 * There is a routine for converting a UTC time into Julian days.
 * The inverse conversion is not attempted.

\chapter{Package \texttt{support}}

This package covers LAL support routines.  These routines do not conform to
LAL requirements so they should be used only for debugging and in test code,
not in production code.  The exeption is those routines in the
\verb+LALMalloc.h+ header, section~\ref{s:LALMalloc.h}, which behave correctly
when \verb+debuglevel+ is set to zero (as it should be for production code).
The routines in this header should be used for all dynamic memory allocation
rather than the standard system functions.

\chapter{Package \texttt{support}}

%% $Id$

This package covers LAL support routines.

These routines do not conform to LAL requirements, and many of them should be
used only for debugging and in test code, not in production code.  These are
compiled and installed as a separate library \texttt{lalsupport}.

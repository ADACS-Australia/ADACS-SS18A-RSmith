/*
 * Compute the Data Quality Vector as defined in
 * https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/wiki/S6OnlineGroup/CalibratedData
 *
 * Copied for reference:
 *
 * State vector channel: IFO:DMT-STATE_VECTOR
 *
 * The data type is float(!) so they have to be first converted to int.
 * Then, bits 0-4 define the states. Bits 5-15 are always set to 1,
 * such that the word 0xffff means science mode:
 *
 * bit0=SCI (operator set to go to science mode)
 * bit1=CON conlog unsets this bit is non-harmless epics changes
 * bit2=UP (set by locking scripts)
 * bit3=!INJ Injections unset this bit
 * bit4=EXC Unauthorized excitations cause this bit to be unset
 *
 * Channel Name: IFO:DMT-DATA_QUALITY_VECTOR where IFO is one of (H1, H2, L1)
 * Sample Rate: 1 Hz, for any state to be true, it must be true every
 * sample of h(t) within the second
 * Type: INT4
 *
 * The quality channel will use the following bitmask definition
 *
 * SCIENCE       1  // SV_SCIENCE & LIGHT
 * INJECTION     2  // Injection: same as statevector
 * UP            4  // SV_UP & LIGHT
 * CALIBRATED    8  // SV_UP & LIGHT & (not TRANSIENT)
 * BADGAMMA     16  // Calibration is bad (outside 0.8 < gamma < 1.2)
 * LIGHT        32  // Light in the arms ok
 * MISSING      64  // Indication that data was dropped in DMT
 *
 * All the arrays must have been previously allocated.
 * r_x is the number of x_value(s) that are in a single DQ sample (=
 * x.length/n_dq). So it is the "rate" of x with respect to DQ samples.
 *
 * Other special meanings:
 *  t_bad_left:  time (in s) of the last NOT-UP event in the Data Quality
 *  t_bad_right: time (in s) of the next NOT-UP event in the Data Quality
 *  wings:       duration (in s) of the wings used for calibration
 *
 * If t_bad_left < wings then it doesn't matter how much less it
 * is. Same thing for t_bad_right > wings.

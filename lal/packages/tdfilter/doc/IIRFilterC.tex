Computes an instant-by-instant IIR filter response.

\subsubsection{Description}

These functions pass a time-domain datum to an object \verb@*filter@
of type \verb@REAL4IIRFilter@ or \verb@REAL8IIRFilter@, and return the
filter response.  This is done using the auxiliary data series
formalism described in the header \verb@IIRFilter.h@.

There are two pairs of routines in this module.  The functions
\verb@IIRFilterReal4()@ and \verb@IIRFilterREAL8()@ conform to the LAL
standard, with status handling and error trapping; the input datum is
passed in as \verb@input@ and the response is returned in
\verb@*output@.  The functions \verb@SIIRFilter()@ and
\verb@DIIRFilter()@ are non-standard lightweight routines, which may
be more suitable for multiple callings from the inner loops of
programs; they have no status handling or error trapping.  The input
datum is passed in by the variable \verb@x@, and the response is
returned through the function's return statement.

Applies a time-reversed IIR filter to a data stream.

\subsubsection{Description}

These functions apply a generic time-domain filter \verb@*filter@ to a
time series \verb@*vector@, as with the routines
\verb@IIRFilterREAL4Vector()@ and \verb@IIRFilterREAL8Vector()@, but
do so in a time-reversed manner.  By successively applying normal and
time-reversed IIR filters to the same data, one squares the magnitude
of the frequency response while canceling the phase shift.  This can
be significant when one wishes to preserve phase correlations across
wide frequency bands.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

Because these filter routines are inherently acausal, the
\verb@filter->history@ vector is meaningless and unnecessary.  These
routines neither use nor modify this data array.

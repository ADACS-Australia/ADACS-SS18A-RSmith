\subsubsection{Description}

These functions apply a generic time-domain filter given by an object
\verb@*filter@ of type \verb@REAL4IIRFilter@ or \verb@REAL8IIRFilter@
to a list \verb@*vector@ of data representing a time series.  This is
done in place using the auxiliary data series formalism described in
\verb@IIRFilter.h@, so as to accomodate potentially large data series.
To filter a piece of a larger dataset, the calling routine may pass a
vector structure whose data pointer and length fields specify a subset
of a larger vector.

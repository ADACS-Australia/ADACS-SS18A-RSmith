/**

\addtogroup pkg_window

\brief This package contains a function to create a vector containing a window (also called a taper, lag window, or
       apodization function).

This package defines two data types, the \c REAL4Window and
\c REAL8Window types.  These are suitable for storing window function
data, providing storage for a sequence of samples as well as metadata about
the window such as the sum-of-squarse of the samples.  The package also
provides a collection of functions to construct a variety of pre-defined
window functions.

The use of window functions in signal analysis is well documented in many
places.

Definitions of most of the window functions can be found in Numerical Recipes [\ref ptvf1992]
equations 13.4.13-13.4.15.  Definitions of the
remaining windows can be found in <em>Spectral analysis for physical
applications</em> [\ref pw93] Section 6.11.  Definition of the Kaiser window can
be found in <em>Discrete-time Signal Processing</em> by Oppenheim and
Schafer, p.474.

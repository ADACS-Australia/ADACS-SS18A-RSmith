\chapter{Package \texttt{waveburst}}

Waveburst DSO accepts from datacon AS\_Q channels from two interferometers
to which wavelet transform
was applied, performs percentile transform on each frequency layer to
select n\% of the pixels (each pixel represents wavelet amplitude 
for the corresponding time frequency range) with the biggest amplitudes and
zero out the rest, the resulting 2D matrices are ANDed to zero out pixels that
are not in time-frequency coincidence, clustering is performed on the remaining
non-zero pixels to further select only clusters satisfying certain
criteria on cluster size, power, correlation, etc. The results are written
to waveburst and waveburst\_mime tables in the database.

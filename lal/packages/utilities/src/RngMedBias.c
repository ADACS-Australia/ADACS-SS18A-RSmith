/** \ingroup RngMedBias_h
    \brief Routine for finding bias in median for exponential distribution
 to be used with any code which uses the running median to estimate PSD.

For the exponential distribution with unit mean and variance, the value of the
median is \f$\log(2.0)\f$ in the limit of infinite sample size. Thus, if we are
using the running median to estimate the PSD, there is a correction factor
of \f$\log(2.0)\f$.  However, for finite sample sizes (i.e. for finite block size
values), there is a bias in the estimator of the median and the correction
factor is different.  This program returns the correct normalization factor
for block sizes from 1 to 1000.  For larger values it returns \f$\log(2.0)\f$ and
returns and error for smaller values.

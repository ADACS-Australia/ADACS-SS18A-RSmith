NOTE:  You must install the package FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the
West) before installing this package.

0.  Install FFTW and (optionally) the FrameL library and MPI:

    You can obtain FFTW from http://www.fftw.org
    When configuring, you must use the --enable-float option.

    You can obtain FrameL from http://wwwlapp.in2p3.fr/virgo/FrameL

    You can obtain the MPICH implementation of MPI from
    http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich
    (this is the implementation that I have used in testing the LAL routines).

    0.1.  To install FFTW on your system use the commands:

          ./configure --enable-float
          make
          make install

          (you must be superuser).

    0.2.  If you are installing FFTW in your personal account:

          ./configure --prefix=/home/alice --enable-float
          make
          make install

          Then you must set a few environment variables before continuing.
          If you are using sh (or bash):

          LIBS=-L/home/alice/lib
          CPPFLAGS=-I/home/alice/include

          If you are using csh (or tcsh):

          setenv LIBS -L/home/alice/lib
          setenv CPPFLAGS -I/home/alice/include

    0.3.  To install the FrameL library (optional) go to the mgr directory of
          the frame library directory structure and run the compilation script
          makecc.  If you install the FrameL in a non-standard location, you
          will need to set the LIBS and CPPFLAGS variables so that the
          library and include files are accessible (as above).

    0.4.  Install the MPICH implementation of MPI (optional).  Then set the
          environment variable MPICC to the name of the MPI C-compiler (which
          is probably a shell script).  For example, if you are using sh:

          MPICC=mpicc

          or if you are using csh:

          setenv MPICC mpicc

          Troubles may arise if you compile LAL with gcc but the MPICC script
          uses some other cc.  In this case, edit the file mpicc to use gcc
          rather than cc.

          Also, make sure that mpirun will work.  This means that you have to
          be able to type

          rsh <hostname>

          (where <hostname> is the name of your computer) and be logged-in
          without typing a password!  This may require you to add a line in
          a file called .rhosts (in your home directory).  For example,
          for mpirun to work on the machine einstein.institute.edu, the file
          /home/alice/.rhosts must include the line

          einstein.institute.edu alice

          Also, the file .rhosts must have read-write privilege by user only.
          To be sure, type

          chmod go-rwx /home/alice/.rhosts

          You (Alice) should then be able to type

          rsh einstein.institute.edu

          and be logged in (without entering a password).


1.  Install the LAL package.

    1.1.  If you are installing LAL on the system, use the commands:

          ./configure [--enable-frame] [--enable-mpi]
          make
          make install

          The --enable-frame argument is only used if you have the FrameL
          library installed and you want to include code that uses this
          library.

          The --enable-mpi argument is only used if you have MPI and want
          to run the code that runs on multiple processors.

          Optionally you can also type

          make check
          make dvi

          to run a suite of test programs and to latex the documentation files
          to produce dvi files.  If you want to test the code that reads frame
          files, type

          LAL_FRAME_PATH=<framedata path>

          if you are using sh (or bash) or

          setenv LAL_FRAME_PATH <framedata path>

          if you are using csh (or tcsh), and then run make check.

    1.2.  If you are installing LAL on your personal account, use:

          ./configure --prefix=/home/alice [--enable-frame] [--enable-mpi]
          make
          make install

          The --enable-frame argument is only used if you have the FrameL
          library installed and you want to include code that uses this
          library.

          The --enable-mpi argument is only used if you have MPI and want
          to run the code that runs on multiple processors.

          Optionally you can also type

          make check
          make dvi

          to run a suite of test programs and to latex the documentation files
          to produce dvi files.  If you want to test the code that reads frame
          files, type

          LAL_FRAME_PATH=<framedata path>

          if you are using sh (or bash) or

          setenv LAL_FRAME_PATH <framedata path>

          if you are using csh (or tcsh), and then run make check.

System-specific installation instructions:


SGI running IRIX 6.5.3 with gcc:

  * Include the flag -n32 the list of compiler flags in the environment CFLAGS.

  * Make sure that the compiler used is gcc by setting the environment CC to
    gcc.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Troubleshooting:

* If you need to re-run configure after it has failed while checking for a
  working FFTW, FrameL, or MPI, make sure to remove the file config.cache.

* The configure script assumes that ranlib is necessary unless it cannot find
  the program in your path.  If ranlib is on your path and you don't need
  ranlib, set the environment RANLIB to echo.

\begin{abstract}
  This document describes data formats to further the interaction
  between gravitational wave source modeling groups and the LIGO
  Scientific Collaboration. The aim is to have a simple format which
  is nevertheless sufficiently general, and is applicable to various
  kinds of sources including binaries of compact objects and systems
  undergoing gravitational collapse.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Numerical relativity has made enormous progress in the last few years.
Many numerical relativity groups now have sufficiently stable and
accurate codes which can accurately simulate the inspiral, merger and
ringdown phases of binary black hole coalescence.  Similarly,
significant progress has been made in the numerical simulation of
stellar gravitational collapse and there now seems to be a much better
understanding of how supernova explosions happen.  All these processes
are among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation and
therefore there is significant interest in using these numerical
relativity results within various data analysis pipelines used within
the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC).  A dialog between numerical
relativists and LSC data analysts was recently initiated in November
2006 through a meeting in Boston, and it seems appropriate to continue
this dialog at a more concrete level, and to start incorporating
numerical relativity results within various LSC data analysis
software.

The aim of this document is to spell out the formats for data exchange
between numerical relativists and the LSC.  It is clear that there are
still outstanding conceptual and numerical issues remaining in these
numerical simulations, and the goal of this document is not to resolve
them.  The goal is twofold: (i) To spell out the technical details of
the waveform data so that they can be incorporated seamlessly within
the data analysis software currently being developed within the LSC,
and (ii) to facilitate the exchange of information between the
numerical relativity and data analysis groups.  We do hope that this
closer interaction will eventually help in resolving some of the open
issues which could be relevant for the detection of gravitational
radiation.

The relevant software development is being carried out as part of the
LSC Algorithms Library \footnote{Available from
  \texttt{http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/projects/lal.html}}
which contains core routines for gravitational wave data analysis
written in ANSI C89, and is distributed under the GNU General Public
License.  

The latest version of this document is available within this
library.\footnote{The location of the document is
  \texttt{lal/doc/NRDataFormat.tex}.}  The remainder of this document
is structured as follows.  Section \ref{sec:multipoles} describes our
conventions for decomposing the gravitational wave data in terms of
spherical harmonics, section \ref{sec:format} specifies the data
formats for binary black hole simulations, section
\ref{sec:openissues} enumerates some open issues in binary black hole
simulations which could be topics of further discussion between data
analysts and numerical relativists, and finally section
\ref{sec:authorship} discusses the authorship and other issues related
to the use of numerical relativity data.



\section{Multipole expansion of the wave}
\label{sec:multipoles}


The output of a numerical relativity code is the full spacetime of a
binary black hole system. On the other hand, what is required for
gravitational wave data analysis purposes is the strain $h(t)$ as
measured by a detector located far away from the source.  The quantity
of interest is therefore the gravitational wave metric perturbation
$h_{ab}$ in the wave-zone, where $a$ and $b$ are space-time indices.
We always work in the Transverse Traceless (TT) gauge so that all
information about the metric perturbation is contained in the TT
tensor $h_{ij}$, where $i$ and $j$ are spatial indices.  The wave
falls off as $1/r$ where $r$ is the distance from the source:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  h_{ij} = A_{ij}\frac{M}{r} + \mathcal{O}\left(r^{-2}\right)\,.
\end{equation}
Here $A_{ij}$ is a transverse traceless tensor and $M$ is the total
mass of the system; this approximation is, naturally, only valid far
away from the source.

There are different methods for extracting $h_{ij}$ from a numerical
evolution.  One common method is to use the complex Weyl tensor
component $\Psi_4$ which is related to the second time derivative of
$h_{ij}$. Another method is to use the Zerilli function which
approximates the spacetime in the wave-zone as a perturbation of a
Schwarzschild spacetime.  For our purposes, it is not important how
the wave is extracted, and different numerical relativity groups are
free to use methods they find appropriate.  The starting point of our
analysis are the multipole moments of $h_{ij}$ and it is important to
describe explicitly our conventions for the multipole decomposition.
In addition to these multipole moments, we also request the
corresponding values of $\Psi_4$ or the Zerilli function in the
formats described later.

Let $(x,y,z,t)$ be a Cartesian coordinate system in the wave zone,
sufficiently far away from the source. Let $\xhat$, $\yhat$ and
$\zhat$ denote the spatial orthonormal coordinate basis vectors.
Given this coordinate system, we define standard spherical coordinates
$(r,\iota,\phi)$ where $\iota$ is the inclination angle from the
$z$-axis and $\phi$ is the phase angle.  At this point, we have not
specified anything about the source.  In fact, the source could be a
binary system, a star undergoing gravitational collapse or anything
else that could be of interest for gravitational wave source modeling.
In a later section we will specialize to binary black hole systems and
suggest possibilities for some of the various choices that have to be
made.  However, as far as possible, these choices are eventually to be
made by the individual source modeling group.

We break up $h_{ij}$ into modes in this coordinate system.  In the
wave zone, the wave will be propagating in the direction of the radial
unit vector
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{3}
    \rhat &=  &\xhat&\,\sin\iota\cos\phi\, &+&\, \yhat\,\sin\iota\sin\phi
    + \zhat\,\cos\iota\,.
\intertext{A natural set of orthogonal basis vectors from which to build the
transverse traceless basis tensors is}
    \iotahat &=
    &\xhat&\,\cos\iota\cos\phi \,&+&\, \yhat\,\cos\iota\sin\phi
    - \zhat\,\sin\iota \,,\\
    \phihat &=
    -\,&\xhat&\,\sin\phi \,&+&\, \yhat\,\cos\phi\,.
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
Note in particular that $\phihat$ is perpendicular to $\zhat$.
In the transverse traceless gauge, $h_{ij}$ is has two independent
polarizations 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \tens{h} = \sum_{i,j}h_{ij}\,\ihat\otimes\jhat
  = h_+ \eplus + h_\times \ecross\,,
\end{equation}
where $\eplus$ and $\ecross$ are the usual basis tensors for
transverse-traceless tensors in the wave frame
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:9}
  \eplus = \iotahat\otimes\iotahat -
  \phihat\otimes\phihat\,, \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad 
  \ecross = \iotahat\otimes\phihat +
  \phihat\otimes\iotahat\,. 
\end{equation}
It is convenient to use the combination $h_+ - ih_\times$ which is
related to $\Psi_4$ by two time derivatives\footnote{We define
  $\Psi_4$ as $\Psi_4 := C_{abcd}\bar{m}^a n^b \bar{m}^c n^d$ where
  $C_{abcd}$ is the Weyl tensor and $a,b\ldots$ denote abstract
  spacetime indices.  If we denote the unit timelike normal to the
  spatial slice as $e_{\hat{t}}^a$ and the promotions of
  $\{\rhat,\iotahat,\phihat\}$ to the full spacetime as
  $\{e_{\hat{r}}^a,e_{\hat{\iota}}^a,e_{\hat{\phi}}^a\}$, then the
  null tetrad adapted to the constant $r$ spheres is
  $\{\ell^a,n^a,m^a,\bar{m}^a\}$ where $\ell^a = (e_{\hat{t}}^a +
  e_{\hat{r}}^a)/\sqrt{2}$, $n^a = (e_{\hat{t}}^a -
  e_{\hat{r}}^a)/\sqrt{2}$, $m^a = (e_{\hat{\iota}}^a +
  ie_{\hat{\phi}}^a)/\sqrt{2}$, and $\bar{m}^a$ is the complex
  conjugate of $m^a$.}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \Psi_4 = \ddot{h}_+ - i\ddot{h}_\times\,.
\end{equation}
It can be shown that $h_+-ih_\times$, can be decomposed into
modes using spin weighted spherical harmonics $\Ys_{lm}$ of weight
-2:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  h_+ - ih_\times = \frac{M}{r}\sum_{\ell=2}^{\infty}\sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell H_{\ell m}(t)\,
  \Ytwo_{\ell m}(\iota,\phi)\,.
\end{equation}
The expansion parameters $H_{lm}$ are complex functions of the retarded time
$t-r$ and, if we fix $r$ to be the radius of the sphere at which we
extract waves, then $H_{lm}$ are functions of $t$ only.  

The explicit expression for the spin weighted spherical harmonics is
in terms of the Wigner $d$-functions
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
   \Ys_{lm} = (-1)^s\sqrt{\frac{2\ell+1}{4\pi}} d^\ell_{m,s}(\iota)e^{im\phi}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:6}
  d^\ell_{m,s}(\iota) = \sum_{k = k_1}^{k_2}
    \frac{(-1)^k[(\ell+m)!(\ell-m)!(\ell+s)!(\ell-s)!]^{1/2}}{(\ell +m
      -k)!(\ell-s-k)!k!(k+s-m)!}  
    \times \left(\frac{\cos\iota}{2}\right)^{2\ell+m-s-2k}\left(\frac{\sin\iota}{2}\right)^{2k+s-m}  
\end{equation}
with $k_1 = \textrm{max}(0, m-s)$ and $k_2=\textrm{min}(\ell+m,
\ell-s)$.  For reference,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:7}
  \Ytwo_{22} &=& \sqrt{\frac{5}{64\pi}}(1+\cos\iota)^2e^{2i\phi} \,,\\
  \Ytwo_{21} &=& \sqrt{\frac{5}{16\pi}}  \sin\iota( 1 + \cos\iota )e^{i\phi} \,,\\
  \Ytwo_{20} &=& \sqrt{\frac{15}{32\pi}} \sin^2\iota \,,\\
  \Ytwo_{2-1} &=& \sqrt{\frac{5}{16\pi}}  \sin\iota( 1 - \cos\iota
  )e^{-i\phi} \,,\\
  \Ytwo_{2-2} &=& \sqrt{\frac{5}{64\pi}}(1-\cos\iota)^2e^{-2i\phi}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The mode expansion coefficients $H_{lm}$ are given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:10}
  MH_{\ell m} = \oint \Ytwo_{lm}^\star(\iota,\phi)(rh_+-irh_\times )\,d\Omega\,.
\end{equation}
If $\Psi_4$ is used for wave extraction, then $H_{lm}$ is given by two
time integrals of the corresponding mode of $\Psi_4$.  In this case, it
is important that the information provided contains details about how
the integration constants be chosen.  We define $h_+^{(\ell m)}$ and
$h_\times^{(\ell m)}$ as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:11}
  rh_+^{(\ell m)}(t) -irh_\times^{(\ell m)}(t) := MH_{\ell m}(t)\,.  
\end{equation}
It is these modes $rh_{+,\times}^{(\ell m)}$ of $rh_+$ and $rh_\times$
that must be provided as functions of time in units of $M$.
% The waveforms are easily reconstructed
% from the modes:
% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:8}
%   rh_+(r,\theta,\phi) - i rh_\times(x,\theta,\phi)
%   = \sum_{lm} \Ytwo_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\left[ H_+^{(\ell m)}(x) - i
%   H_\times^{(\ell m)}\right]
% \end{equation}




\section{Data formats}
\label{sec:format}


Let us now specialize to simulations of binary black hole coalescence.
A numerical relativity simulation has many parameters which need to be
specified, and many of which may not be directly relevant to the data
analysis problem.  We need to specify which parameters of the numerical
simulation will be significantly useful for the astrophysics of a binary
black hole system in a circular orbit.  For our purposes, a single
numerical waveform is defined by at least seven parameters: the mass
ratio $q = M_1/M_2$, the three components of the individual spins
$\vec{S}_1$ and $\vec{S}_2$.  These parameters will be referred to as
the ``metadata'' for a waveform; more parameters can be added as
necessary. We use the convention that $M_1$ denotes the larger of the
two masses so that $q\geq 1$.  The choice of precisely how $M_1$, $M_2$
and the spins are calculated is left up to the individual numerical
relativity groups.  

The data for a single mode $rh_{+,\times}^{(\ell m)}$ is to be written
as a plain text file in three columns for the time $t$, $rh_+^{(\ell
m)}$ and $rh_\times^{(\ell m)}$ respectively.  For a given simulation,
we leave it to the numerical groups to decide the maximum value of $\ell
= \ell_{max}$ to which they will provide the waveform.  We require that
for every $\ell \le \ell_{max}$ they provide the waveform for all values
of $m=-\ell,\ldots,\ell-1,\ell$.  This must be done irrespective of any
symmetries that may be present in the simulation.  If there are certain
modes which, due to small amplitude, cannot be accurately determined,
these can be set to zero.  Numerical groups often extract the waveform
from the simulation at several different radii and then use Richardson
extrapolation to determine the most accurate waveform.  We would not
consider waveforms from different radii as distinct, and would prefer
only the most accurate determination of the waveform from any given
simulation.

The time and strain columns must be in units of the total mass $M$ of
the binary.  There can be subtleties in the choice of $M$.  It could be
the ADM mass of the spacetime, an approximation to the ADM mass measured
at the wave-extraction sphere, or it could be the sum of the individual
masses.  Again, the choice is left up to the numerical relativity group
which produced the waveform.  It should be whatever best represents the
time coordinate and the scale of $h_{ij}$ in the particular simulation.

For data analysis purposes, the sampling in time must be uniform in
units of $M$.  If the result of a simulation or set of simulations
yields a waveform sampled non-uniformly, we ask that the NR group
interpolate to give a uniformly sampled waveform.  A sampling rate of
$1\times M$ is usually sufficient for our purposes, but this is not a
requirement.  The strain multiplied by the distance will also be in
units of the total mass $M$ of the binary.  There can be any number of
comment lines at the top of the file and it is envisioned that the
details of the simulation and the mode contained in the file will be
held in the comment lines.

This is an example of a data file:

\begin{verbatim}
# numerical waveform from ....
# equal mass, non spinning, 5 orbits, l=m=2

3.400000e+00 1.138757e-02 -7.902739e-03
......
\end{verbatim}

The metadata information for the different datafiles will be stored in a
separate file.  This metadata file must contain (at least) two sections,
one for the simulation metadata, and the other listing the filenames
which correspond to the various $(\ell,m)$ modes of the waveform.  There
will be a separate metadata file for each waveform.

This is an example of a metadata file:

\begin{verbatim}
[metadata]
simulation-details = NRfile.dat
nr-group = friendlyNRgroup
email = myemail@somewhere.edu
mass-ratio = 1.0
spin1x = 0.0
spin1y = 0.0
spin1z = 0.5
spin2x = 0.0
spin2y = 0.8
spin2z = 0.0

[ht-data]
2,2  = example1_22.dat
2,1  = example1_21.dat
2,0  = example1_20.dat
2,-1 = example1_2-1.dat
2,-2 = example1_2-2.dat
\end{verbatim}

It would be desirable if the waveform data are reproducible at
a later date if necessary.  For this purpose, the numerical relativity
groups are required to submit a file with the parameters of the
simulation.  There is no requirement on the format of this file.  
The \texttt{simulation-details} line will contain the name of the file
describing the parameters used to describe the NR simulation.  In
addition, we ask for the numerical relativity groups to provide a
\texttt{nr-group} name and a contact \texttt{email}.

The remainder of the entries in the \texttt{[metadata]} section describe
the physical parameters of the waveform.  To begin with, for
non-spinning waveforms, the only required parameter is the mass ratio.
For waveforms with spin, the initial spins of the two black holes (in
the co-ordinates discussed in the previous section) must also be
specified. It should be emphasized that when necessary, we will add more
parameters such as, for example, the eccentricity of the orbit. Lines
starting with a $\%$ or $\#$ will be taken to be comment lines; there
can be an arbitrary number of comment lines.

The section \texttt{[ht-data]} contains one line for each $(\ell,m)$
mode.  These give the file names containing the corresponding modes.
The filenames must give the relative paths to the data files starting
from the location of the metadata file.  Thus, if the datafiles are
stored in a sub-directory called \texttt{data}, then the metadata file
would read:
\begin{verbatim}
[ht-data]
2,2  = data/example1_22.dat
2,1  = data/example1_21.dat
2,0  = data/example1_20.dat
2,-1 = data/example1_2-1.dat
2,-2 = data/example1_2-2.dat
\end{verbatim}

If the waveforms have been calculated using $\Psi_4$, then for
cross-checking purposes, we request that datafiles containing the real
and imaginary parts of $\Psi_4$ also be provided in the same format as
for the waveforms, i.e. three columns which are respectively time, real
part of $\Psi_4$ and imaginary part of $\Psi_4$.  Again there can be an
arbitrary number of comment lines, but in this case there does not need
to be a metadata file.  This data should be referenced in the metadata
file in an additional section:

\begin{verbatim}
[psi4-data]
2,2  = data/example1_psi4_22.dat
2,1  = data/example1_psi4_21.dat
2,0  = data/example1_psi4_20.dat
2,-1 = data/example1_psi4_2-1.dat
2,-2 = data/example1_psi4_2-2.dat
\end{verbatim}

Similarly, if the waveform were extracted using the Zerilli formalism, a
section \texttt{[zerilli-data]} would be added.

To summarize, the numerical relativity groups are asked to submit a
tarball containing the following information for each simulation:
\begin{description}
\item[1.][Required] The data files for $h_+$ and $h_\times$ -- one for
  each $(\ell,m)$ mode of the simulation.
\item[2.][Required] The meta-data file.
\item[3.][Optional] Data files for the functions (e.g. $\Psi_4$ or the
  Zerilli function) which were used to construct $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$.
\item[4.][Required] Parameter file for reproducing the waveform.
\end{description}




\section{Open Issues for binary black hole systems}
\label{sec:openissues}

We now list some open issues for binary black hole simulations which
could be topics for further discussion.

We associate the coordinate system $(x,y,z,t)$ with the binary system
as follows.  The orbital plane of the binary at $t=0$ is taken to be
the $x$-$y$ plane with the $z$-axis in the direction of the orbital
angular momentum.
\begin{itemize}
\item Is this the best choice of the $z$-axis?  Would it be better to
  choose, say, the spin of the final black hole as the $z$-axis? The
  decisions will be determined by requirements of simplicity and
  having as few modes to work with as possible.
\item The orbital plane is unambiguous when the black holes are non-spinning
  but it can be ambiguous in many situations, especially when the spin
  of the black holes causes the orbital plane to precess significantly.
  In such cases, it is left to the numerical relativity group to decide
  what the best choice of the ``orbital plane'' should be. 
\end{itemize}
What is the right choice for parameters such as the individual masses,
the total mass and the spins?  Here are some possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item $M_1$ and $M_2$ could be the parameters appearing in the initial
  data construction.  Alternatively, for non spinning black holes,
  they could be the irreducible masses of the two horizons:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:12}
    M_{irr} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{16\pi}}
  \end{equation}
  where $A$ is the horizon area.  For spinning black holes it could be
  given by the Christodoulou formula:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:13}
    M_{J} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{16\pi} + \frac{4\pi J^2}{A}}
  \end{equation}
  where $J$ is an appropriately defined spin for the individual black
  holes.  The calculation of $J$ is again left up to the numerical
  relativity group.
\item For the total mass $M$, should we use the sum of individual
  horizon masses (including the effect of angular momentum), or should
  it be the total ADM mass or rather, an approximation to the ADM mass
  calculated at the sphere where the waves are extracted.  This could
  be specified in the metadata file.  For example, additional lines
  \begin{verbatim}
     mADM = 1.0
     mChristodoulou = 0.97
  \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
What is the best choice for the radiation extraction sphere?
\begin{itemize}
\item How far away should the sphere be?  Is it sufficient to take the
  sphere to be a coordinate sphere, or do we need some further gauge
  conditions?
\end{itemize}
How important is the choice of initial data?
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly, the initial data used in almost all current simulations
  do not exactly represent real astrophysical binary black hole
  systems.  Is this deviation important for gravitational wave
  detection?
\end{itemize}
How large are the error-bars on the numerical results?
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there a reliable way to estimate the systematic errors due to
  finite resolution effects, different gauge choices, wave extraction
  methods etc?  
\end{itemize}

Numerical relativity groups are welcome to raise any other issues that
might be important.


\section{Exchange of Waveform Data}
\label{sec:authorship}

After further consultation with numerical relativity community, a
webpage will be set up where waveform data can be uploaded in the
format specified above.  Access to this webpage will be open to any
numerical relativity group which wishes to participate.  It is
expected (though not required) that the waveforms supplied to the LSC
through this forum have previously been published in a peer reviewed
scientific journal or on a preprint archive.  Submission of the
waveforms does not restrict their use for other purposes by the
numerical relativity group.  Any publication arising from these
waveform data will cite the appropriate publication and funding agency
as required by the numerical relativity group.

Uploading the waveforms does not by any means guarantee that they will
be used by the LSC to analyze real data from the LIGO and GEO
detectors.  It also does not imply any authorship rights on possible
publications that may arise from this data.  Submitted data will not
be public; access is restricted to LSC members only.  Finally,
regarding any publications arising from this data, the numerical
relativity group(s) which provided the waveform will be consulted
before public release.

\end{document}

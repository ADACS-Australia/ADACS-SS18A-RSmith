	This function has the same behaviour as load_filename() but accepts

	urllib2 library can read data is acceptable.  stdin is parsed if
	the URL is None.  If the optional xmldoc argument is provided and

	Example:

	>>> xmldoc = utils.load_url("file://localhost/tmp/data.xml")

	Bugs:
	  - Due to limitations in Python's gzip support and in the way its
	    URL library transfers data, it is not possible to read gzipped
	    XML files from remote locations.  Reading gzipped XML files
	    locally should work correctly.

		# that does not support seeking, which prevents GzipFile
		# from working correctly;  by opening local files as
		# regular files, this gets gzip support working for the
		# local case;  still can't read .xml.gz files from a remote
		# host, though;  what's needed is some kind of buffering

def write_filename(xmldoc, filename, verbose = False, gz = False):
	"""
	Writes the LIGO Light Weight document tree rooted at xmldoc to the
	file name filename.  Friendly verbosity messages are printed while
	doing so if verbose is True.  The output data is gzip compressed on
	the fly if gz is True.
	
	This function traps SIGTERM and SIGTSTP during the write process,
	and it does this by temporarily installing its own signal handlers
	in place of the current handlers.  This is done to prevent Condor
	eviction during the write process.  If a signal is trapped, then
	when the write process has successfully concluded, the last thing
	this function does is raise IOTrappedSignal, with the most-recently
	trapped signal number as the argument.  This is the only condition
	in which this function will raise that exception, so calling code
	that wishes its own handler to be executed can arrange for that to
	happen by trapping the IOTrappedSignal exception.

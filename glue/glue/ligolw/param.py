# FIXME: params of type string should be quoted in order to correctly
# delimit their extent.  If that were done, then the pcdata in a Param
# element could be parsed using the Stream tokenizer (i.e., as though it
# were a single-token stream), which would guarantee that Stream data and
# Param data is parsed using the exact same rules.  Unfortunately, common
# practice is to not quote Param string values, so we parse things
# differently here.  In particular, we strip whitespace from the start and
# stop of all Param pcdata.  If this causes your string Param values to be
# corrupted (because you need leading and trailing white space preserved),
# then you need to make everyone switch to quoting their string Param
# values, and once that is done then this code will be changed.  Perhaps a
# warning should be emitted for non-quoted strings to encourage a
# transition?

def MultiIter(*sequences):
	"""
	A generator for iterating over the elements of multiple sequences
	simultaneously.  With N sequences given as input, the generator
	yields all possible distinct N-tuples that contain one element from
	each of the input sequences.

	Example:

	>>> x = MultiIter([0, 1, 2], [10, 11])
	>>> list(x)
	[(0, 10), (1, 10), (2, 10), (0, 11), (1, 11), (2, 11)]

	The elements in each output tuple are in the order of the input
	sequences, and the left-most input sequence is iterated over first.

	The input sequences are each iterated over only once, so it is safe
	to pass generators as arguments.  Also, this generator is
	significantly faster if the longest input sequence is given as the
	first argument.  For example, this code

	>>> lengths = range(1, 12)
	>>> for x in MultiIter(*map(range, lengths)):
	...	pass
	...

	runs approximately 5 times faster if the lengths list is reversed.
	"""
	if len(sequences) > 1:
		# FIXME:  experiment with a generator expression in Python
		# >= 2.5
		# FIXME:  this loop is about 5% faster if done the other
		# way around, if the last list is iterated over in the
		# inner loop.  but there is code, like snglcoinc.py in
		# pylal, that has been optimized for the current order and
		# would need to be reoptimized if this function were to be
		# reversed.

def choices(vals, n):
	"""
	A generator for iterating over all choices of n elements from the
	input sequence vals.  In each result returned, the original order
	of the values is preserved.

	Example:

	>>> x = choices(["a", "b", "c"], 2)
	>>> list(x)
	[('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c')]

	The order of combinations in the output sequence is always the
	same, so if choices() is called twice with two different sequences
	of the same length the first combination in each of the two output
	sequences will contain elements from the same positions in the two
	different input sequences, and so on for each subsequent pair of
	output combinations.

	Example:

	>>> x = choices(["a", "b", "c"], 2)
	>>> y = choices(["1", "2", "3"], 2)
	>>> zip(x, y)
	[(('a', 'b'), ('1', '2')), (('a', 'c'), ('1', '3')), (('b', 'c'),
	('2', '3'))]

class Highest(list):
	"""
	A class for use when you need to collect the largest in a very long
	sequence of things, a sequence too long to hold in memory all at
	once and sort.  This class behaves like a list, in fact it is a
	Python list, but one that stores only some fraction of all items
	that have been added to it.  The list is always sorted in
	decreasing order, so the 0th element is the highest-valued item
	added to the list and so on.

	To function correctly the list must remain sorted, so the insert()
	and __setitem__() methods are disabled.  Only the append() and
	extend() methods can be used to add elements to the list.  The
	__len__() method returns the total number of items that have been
	added to the list ever, not the number that are actually stored in
	it at any given time.  To retrieve the number of items actually
	stored in memory, use the list class' __len__() method.  See the
	example below.

	Example:

	>>> import random
	>>> l = Highest(max = 3)
	>>> for i in range(10000):
	...	l.append(random.random())
	...
	>>> l

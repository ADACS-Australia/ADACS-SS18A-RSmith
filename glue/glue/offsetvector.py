	>>> x["H1"]
	0

		Dictionary of relative offsets.  The keys in the result are
		pairs of keys from the offset vector, (a, b), and the
		values are the relative offsets, (offset[b] - offset[a]).

		Note that the result always includes a "dummy" entry,
		giving the relative offset of self.refkey with respect to
		itself, which is always 0.

		See also .fromdeltas().

		BUGS:  I think the keys in each tuple should be reversed.
		I can't remember why I put them in the way they are.
		Expect them to change in the future.

These are test/demo files for ligolw_vetosegs, which is an
implementation of the program described in section 2, point 3 of
https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/daswg/docs//technical/T0900005.pdf.

The H1-TEST_SEGS-* files simulate files produced by the DMT.
H1-VETOTEST-800000000-128.xml is a sample DQ categorization file.
Conceptually the program does the following:


For each ifo
   for each veto category
      for each distinct entry in the DQ veto_definer table of that veto category or lower
         find the intersection with each DMT segment
      take the union of all such segments
      generate xml/txt files
    

Running

  ligolw_vetosegs -q  H1-TEST_SEGS-\* -v H1-VETOTEST-800000000-128.xml

will regenerate the H1-VETOTIME_CAT*xml and H1-VETOTIME_CAT*txt files,
which contain times that should be vetoed.

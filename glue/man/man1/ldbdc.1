.IR query ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIldbdc\fP inserts a LIGO lightweight XML file into the specified
database and/or executes an SQL query returning the results as a LIGO
lightweight XML to the standard output or a file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-s,\-\-server " host:port"
connect to ldbd server at \fIhost\fP on \fIport\fP
.TP
.BI -j,\-\-identity " subject"
Use \fIsubject\fP as the subject of the server's identity certificate.
If no identity is specified, the client assumes that it should expect 
an ldbdserver service certificate issued by the DOE for the hostname
specifed by \fIhost\fP
.TP
.BI -d,\-\-database " name"
interact with the database called \fIname\fP on \fIhost\fP
.TP
.BI -i,\-\-insert " file"
insert the data in the LIGO lightweight XML file names \fIfile\fP into
the database
.TP
.BI -q,\-\-query " query"
Execute the SQL query \fIquery\fP at the specified database and return
the results of the query as a LIGO lightweight XML file
.TP
.BI -o,\-\-output " file"
Write the returned LIGO lightweight XML file to \fIfile\fP insted of
the standard output.
.TP
.BI -v,\-\-verbose
print lots of debugging information during execution
.TP
.BI -h,\-\-help
print a brief usage message
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
An exit status of 0 means that the no errors ocourred, 1 means that there
was an error communicating with the server and 2 means that the server
returned an error to the client.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
ldbdc --server metaserver.phys.uwm.edu --database uwm_dev --insert test.xml

Inserts the LIGO lightweight XML file test.xml into the uwm_dev database at metaserver.phys.uwm.edu
.PP
ldbdc --server metaserver.phys.uwm.edu:60000 --database uwm_dev --query "SELECT * FROM SNGL_INSPIRAL" --output inspiralevents.xml

Retrieves all the entries from the SNGL_INSPIRAL table in the uwm_dev database at metaserver.phys.uwm.edu on port 60000 and writes the results to the file inspiralevents.xml

.SH BUGS
.PP
If the query produces a large amount of data, it can take the server a long
time to parse it into LIGO lightweight XML. This is due to the code in the
server being a prototype algorithm which will be optimised soon.

This page uses the "--report" function in ligolw_dq_query tool.<br/><br/>
If you choose to use the -i flag, it will print out which flags are defined and active at the given time(s). <br/>
For an active flag, it prints the start and end time of the segment to which the active flag belongs. <br/><br/>
If you choose not to use the -i flag, it will print out which flags are defined/undefined at the given time(s). <br/>
For the flags which were defined, it determines if the flag was active or inacti
ve at that time.<br/>
For an active flag, it prints the start and end time of the segment to which the
 active flag belongs. <br/>
For an inactive flag, it prints the end time of the privious adjacent active seg
ment and the start time of the next adjacent active segment.

'''
For N templates in the uberbank, the overlaps form an NxN symmetric matrix. Currently, there are many subbank overlap files that comprise the uberbank, each of which is a rectangular section of the non-symmetric part of the overlap matrix. The subbanks are essentially arbitrary in size. Templates with overlaps < 0.25 are also not computed (this may need to change in the future).
This code creates a database for locating the overlaps between templates in the uberbank. This database allows one to retrieve all the overlaps for a particular template. The overlaps are placed into a 1xN numpy array and are ordered.

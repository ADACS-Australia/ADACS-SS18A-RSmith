    Apply bilinear interpolation to a multiresolution HEALPix map, assuming
    that runs of pixels containing identical values are nodes of the tree. This
    smooths out the stair-step effect that may be noticeable in contour plots.

    Here is how it works. Consider a coarse tile surrounded by base tiles, like
    this:

                +---+---+
                |   |   |
                +-------+
                |   |   |
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+
        |   |   |       |   |   |
        +-------+       +-------+
        |   |   |       |   |   |
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+
                |   |   |
                +-------+
                |   |   |
                +---+---+

    The value within the central coarse tile is computed by downsampling the
    sky map (averaging the fine tiles), upsampling again (with bilinear
    interpolation), and then finally copying the interpolated values within the
    coarse tile back to the full-resolution sky map. This process is applied
    recursively at all successive HEALPix resolutions.

    Note that this method suffers from a minor discontinuity artifact at the
    edges of regions of coarse tiles, because it temporarily treats the
    bordering fine tiles as constant. However, this artifact seems to have only
    a minor effect on generating contour plots.

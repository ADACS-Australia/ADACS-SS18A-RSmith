>1. units of tbase should be defined to be seconds

Done.

>2. df should be explicitly stated to be 1/tbase

Done.  But note that in many common cases (eg, tbase=60 seconds), df
can NOT be exactly represented by an IEEE-754 double.  For example, in
this case:
1.0/60.0 = 
0.001666666..... (base 10) =
2^-6 x 1.000100010001000... (base 2)
which can not be represented exactly as an
IEEE-754 double.  In this case, "approximating" 1/tbase using IEEE-754
doubles yields the 52-binary-point approximation:
2^-6 x 1.0001000100010001000100010001000100010001000100010001 (base 2)
which is (exactly)
0.0166666666666666664353702032030923874117434024810791015625 (base 10)

The fact that df (for many cases of interest) can not be exactly
represented as an IEEE-754 double is the primary reason why the SFT
format uses tbase as fundamental.

>3. padding field should be used to stored what is called S

Unfortunately this can not be done.  The reason is that if an SFT is
'narrowbanded' this can be done in two ways.  One way is to use a
downsampled data set (with a smaller value of S).  The other way is to
simply extract a smaller set of frequency bins from an SFT sampled at
a higher sample rate.  These would yield identical SFT data files but
with DIFFERENT values of S.

>4. reading software (or validation program) needs to check that
>    the comment contains a NUL character followed by NUL characters

Good point.  We've modified the reference library and SFTvalidate code
to issue an error in the case where either the comment is not NULL
terminated, or in the case where a NULL character in the comment is
followed by non-NULL characters.

The spec has been modified so that when this information is required,
it is contained in the comment block.

>6. there needs to be a convention for SFT filenames

Agreed.  Suggestions?

It would be convenient to include this information in the SFT file
name.  Then it could be easily read by software using the SFT, and
could also be incorporated into the SFTvalidate code.

We were aware of this limitation.  It was discussed at length and is a
deliberate choice.

Noted.

After discussion the pulgroup has added some additional requirements
to the spec, namely that

The SFT blocks in a given SFT file are required to have:
(1) identical version numbers
(2) monotonically increasing GPS times
(3) identical values of tbase
(4) identical values of first_frequency_index
(5) identical values of nsamples
(6) come from the same instrument and instrument channel

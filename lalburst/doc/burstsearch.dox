/**
\addtogroup pkg_burstsearch

Functions for the implementation of the standard burst searches:

<ul>

<li> A standard interface for burst event trigger generators.</li>

<li> A function for the estimation of burst parameters.</li>

<li> A wrapper for the TFCLUSTERS algorithm.</li>

<li> A wrapper for the SLOPE algorithm.</li>

<li> A set of functions to implement the excess power search technique which was suggested in
Ref.\ [\ref fh1998] and later independently invented in Ref.\ [\ref acdhp1999].  The implementation here
is described in detail in Ref.\ [\ref ABCF2000].
</li>
</ul>

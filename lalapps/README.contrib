INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTRIBUTORS

LALApps is rather free-form. The golden rule is:

  Your code must be ANSI C 89 for maximum portability

If you like uniformity, I recommend that you copy what is already there.  If
you like to do your own thing, that's fine too.  Here are the essential
instructions.


1. Sources:

   Put your sources in a subdirectory, hereafter src/myprogdir, of the src
   subdirectory.  Sources include all your .c files and all your .h files.
   As a general rule, bundle a bunch of programs that are related (e.g., using
   the same source files or pertaining to the same search type) into a single
   subdirectory.

   If you have created a new subdirectory within the src subdirectory, edit
   the file src/Makefile.am to add the new directory (myprogdir) to the SUBDIRS
   line.  Copy the file src/example/Makefile.am to src/myprogdir and edit it
   to build the new program (see below).  Also add the new Makefile
   (src/myprogdir/Makefile) to the AC_OUTPUT command at the end of the
   configure.in file (in the top lalapps directory).

   Edit the file src/myprogdir/Makefile.am so that your program is built.  The
   program that is built should have a name like lalapps_myprog.  This is so
   that you don't clobber another program that somewhat may have installed with
   the same name.  Suppose your sources are myprog.c and myprog.h.  Then the
   Makefile.am should have the line

     lalapps_myprog_SOURCES = myprog.c myprog.h

   Finally, be sure to add lalapps_myprog to the bin_PROGRAMS variable.

   Note that the file src/myprogdir/Makefile.am should have a line like:

     INCLUDES = -I$(top_srcdir)/src

   if you need to include config.h, or the lines

     INCLUDES = -I$(top_srcdir)/src -I$(top_srcdir)/src/lalapps
     LDADD = $(top_builddir)/src/lalapps/liblalapps.la

   if you are also using the lalapps routines.


2. Documentation:

   Documentation is essential if you want anyone to use your program.  The
   documentation is located in the doc subdirectory.

   The way to document your program is to write a texfile to be included in the
   lalapps texfile lalapps.tex.  You would write a texfile called myprog.tex.
   It should start with:

     \section{Program \texttt{lalapps\_myprog}}
     \idx[Program]{lalapps\_myprog}

   and go from there.

   Then you need to get lalapps.tex to include it.  Down near the bottom of
   the file lalapps.tex you should add the line

     \include{myprog}

   (the location is obvious).

   Finally, edit the Makefile.am so that myprog.tex appears as one of the
   TEXSOURCEFILES.

   If you have figures, make sure that you have both a pdf and eps version.
   If you only have an eps figure, myfig.eps, create a pdf version using the
   command

     epstopdf myfig

   To load the figure in the documentation, use the LaTeX command

     \includegraphics{myfig}

   (note: no extension).  Also be sure that myfig.eps and myfig.pdf both appear
   in the TEXSOURCEFILES line of Makefile.am.


3. Manual pages: (optional)

   If you want a man page installed for your program, put it in the man
   subdirectory.  Also add it to the MANS line in the Makefile.am.


4. Make sure it works:

   Try building the program using

     make

   the documentation using

     make dvi

   and installing everything using

     make install

   then clean everything up using

     make cvs-clean

   If one of these things fails, and it is because of something you did,
   fix it before committing your changes to the git repository.

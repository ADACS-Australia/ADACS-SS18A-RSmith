This is LALApps version 0.1.

Instructions to get, compile, and install LALApps from the CVS repository:

  0.  Get and install LAL
      (see http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/lal)

  1.  Get LALApps and bootstrap it

        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/cvs/lal login

      (the password is lal)

        cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:/usr/local/cvs/lal checkout lalapps
        cd lalapps
        ./00boot

      (you will need m4, aclocal, autoheader, automake, and autoconf)

  2.  Configure LALApps

        ./configure

      Some useful options to configure:

          --prefix=PREFIX
              install in PREFIX rather than /usr/local

          --with-extra-cppflags=CPPFLAGS
              additional preprocessor flags (usually -I or -D flags)

          --with-extra-cppflags=CFLAGS
              additional compiler flags

          --with-extra-ldflags=LDFLAGS
              additional linker flags

          --with-extra-libs=LIBS
              additional library flags (usually -l or -L flags)


  3.  Build and install LALApps

        make
        make dvi
        make install


  4.  Uninstall or cleanup (if desired) using

        make uninstall

      or
      
        make distclean

      respectively.



Please read the INSTALL file for additional help on installation.

                      INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTRIBUTORS



LALApps is rather free-form.  If you like uniformity, I recommend that you copy
what is already there.  If you like to do your own thing, that's fine too.
Here are the essential instructions.


1. Sources:

   Put your sources in the src subdirectory.  Sources include all your .c files
   and all your .h files.

   Edit the Makefile.am so that your program is built.  The program that is
   built should have a name like lalapps_myprog.  This is so that you don't
   clobber another program that somewhat may have installed with the same name.
   Suppose your sources are myprog.c and myprog.h.  Then the Makefile.am should
   have the line

     lalapps_myprog_SOURCES = myprog.c myprog.h

   If you also use some of the functionality in lalapps.c and lalapps.h then
   you should have

     lalapps_myprog_SOURCES = myprog.c myprog.h lalapps.c lalapps.h

   Finally, be sure to add lalapps_myprog to the bin_PROGRAMS variable.


2. Documentation:

   Documentation is essential if you want anyone to use your program.  The
   documentation is located in the doc subdirectory.
   
   The way to document your program is to write a texfile to be included in the
   lalapps texfile lalapps.tex.  You would write a texfile called myprog.tex.
   It should start with:

     \section{Program \texttt{lalapps\_myprog}}
     \idx[Program]{lalapps\_myprog}

   and go from there.

   Then you need to get lalapps.tex to include it.  Down near the bottom of
   the file lalapps.tex you should add the line

     \include{myprog}

   (the location is obvious).

   Finally, edit the Makefile.am so that myprog.tex appears as one of the
   TEXSOURCEFILES.

   If you have figures, make sure that you have both a pdf and eps version.
   If you only have an eps figure, myfig.eps, create a pdf version using the
   command

     epstopdf myfig

   To load the figure in the documentation, use the LaTeX command

     \includegraphics{myfig}

   (note: no extension).  Also be sure that myfig.eps and myfig.pdf both appear
   in the TEXSOURCEFILES line of Makefile.am.


3. Manual pages: (optional)

   If you want a man page installed for your program, put it in the man
   subdirectory.  Also add it to the MANS line in the Makefile.am.


4. Make sure it works:

   Try building the program using

     make

   the documentation using

     make dvi

   and installing everything using

     make install

   then clean everything up using

     make cvs-clean

   If one of these things fails, and it is because of something you did,
   fix it before committing your changes to the cvs repository.

   If everything works, then you can add your files to the cvs repository.  Use
   cvs add to add each file that is needed.  Then do a cvs commit to actually
   put them in.

   If you are really paranoid, checkout a brand new copy of lalapps from the
   cvs repository and make sure that things work.  This will let you know if
   you forgot to add a critical file.

HOW TO USE
----------

[0] HOW IT WORKS

There are two executables: makefakedata_v2 and s3inject.

Included is a simple Makefile to build these executables, which needs
paths to the LAL include files and libraries.  I've tested this with
LAL 2.1 under both solaris and linux. I've included a Makefile.solaris
and Makefile.linux.  make -f Makefile.yourOS should do it.

makefakedata_v2 generates a continuous stream of data for a single
pulsar, using a file called Pulsar.N to get the pulsar's parameters,
and command line arguments to get the starting GPS time and detector
name.  It can write either to files or to stdout.

s3inject starts up M copies of makefakedata, each with a
different set of parameters, gathers their output, and adds it
together, writing it to stdout.

Both of these executables support a "-h" command-line argument that
will give you a command-line argument summary description.  Try it
before reading further:

./makefakedata_v2 -h
./s3inject -h

In this document we assume you will inject 5 pulsar signals total.

[1] HOW TO USE IT -- CREATE PULSAR PARAMETER FILES

Create a files called Pulsar.0 to Pulsar.4 containing the parameters
of the pulsars that you wish the inject.  These files should be
"almost" identical at the different sites.  They only differ because
the Actuation function differs between the sites.

I have included five files - but note that the parameters to be used
"for real" still need to be determined.  People who should help
creating these parameter files include: Riles, S. Anderson,
G. Mendell, X. Siemens, G. Woan and M. Landry.  These files, once
created, should be made read-only, and should only be modified if the
instrument Actuation function changes.  Be sure to save a copy of them
someplace safe.

Note: Each pulsar's parameters are defined at a particular fiducial
Solar System Barycenter (SSB) time.  In this document, I call this
time t_S.  I suggest for E10 and S3 we use t_S=751680013 (November 1,
2003, 00:00:00 UTC). The actual choice of this time is not important,
but it should be fixed and invariant.  The team defining pulsar
parameters may wish to change the value to something that they find
convenient.

At the end of this document is a more detailed description of the
Pulsar.N parameter files.

Some useful GPS times are:
October 17, 2003 00:00:00 UTC  750384013
October 24, 2003 00:00:00 UTC  750988813
November  1 2003 00:00:00 UTC  751680013
December 31 2003 00:00:00 UTC  756864013

[2] HOW TO USE IT -- CREATE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT FILES

Create files called in.0 to in.4.  Each file should contain one line.
This is used to construct the command-line arguments for
makefakedata_v2.

 The file in.0 should look like this:

./makefakedata_v2 -i Pulsar.0 -I LHO -S 751680013 -b

and the other in.N files should be identical except that they should
contain Pulsar.N.  The in.N files at LLO should contain "LLO" rather
than "LHO".

Note: the path "./makefakedata_v2" should if possible be replaced by a
complete path, ie one starting with "/".

[3] HOW TO USE IT -- VERIFY SETUP

To test your setup, do the following:
./s3inject -n 5 -G 751680013 -s

The "-s" option is a show option.  It makes ./s3inject read
the command line files in.N and show you the EXACT commands it would
actually run (preceeded by an integer count of the form [XX]).  The
'-G' command line argument is the GPS time at which to start producing
data.

Now let's make some output (but just from one pulsar):
./s3inject -n 1 -G 751680013 -T -X 2> infolog  | head -20

The 2> infolog redirects stderr into an information log. Have a look.

The -T option makes s3inject output in human readable text
rather than binary

The -X option makes s3inject output an X axis as well.

Notice that the first number output by s3inject is ALWAYS
1234.5, which is a key to use in checking endian ordering and general
sanity.

Now let's go "whole hog":
./s3inject -n 5 -G 751680013 2> infolog  | od -w4 -f | more
This shows you the raw binary output in single column format

[4] HOW TO USE IT -- CPU and RESOURCE USE

On my 1 GHz PIII laptop, this job:
./s3inject -n 5 -G 751680013 2> infolog  > /dev/null

runs at five time real time speed, has a starup latency of around 1
second, and uses 11 MB of memory per pulsar (55 MB total).

[5] HOW TO USE IT -- DEFINING Pulsar.* files

The definitions in Pulsar.N
---------------------------

This file should contain one number per line, followed by white space
(tabs or space) followed by text.  The text is NOT optional!

Here is a typical file:

30.0			Tsft in seconds.  Lenth of time chunks made internally
200000			nTsft: the number of chunks made.  This is large enough for > 2 months
0.0			Frequency f0 start with
8192.0			Frequency band (sets sample rate)
0.0			Sigma (std of noise).  When 0, only signal present.
1.0			Aplus
0.0			Across
0.0			psi
0.0			phi0
789.01234567890123	f0 frequency
0.23456789012345	lattitude in radians (declination delta)
0.345678901234567890	longitude in radians (right ascension alpha)
2			Number of spindown parameters (in this case, two)
-1.e-8			Value of f_1 (note, here f_1=f0_LAL*f1_LAL)
-1.e-17			Value of f_2 (note, here f_2=f0_LAL*f2_LAL)

Sky position:

This structure contains gravitational wave source position (in
Equatorial coordinates), and orientation angle.

[The following paragraph is quoted almost-verbatim from the LAL 2.1
documentation, header SkyCoordinates.h.]

Equatorial coordinates are the standard sky-fixed coordinate
system. The z-axis is defined as for geographic coordinates, above;
the plane orthogonal to this passing through the Earth's centre is
called the equator. The x-axis is defined to be the direction, as
viewed from the centre of the Earth, where the Sun appears to cross
the equator moving north in spring. This is called the vernal equinox,
and is shown in Fig. 16.6. In this coordinate system, the latitude
coordinate is called the declination \delta and the longitude
coordinate is called the right ascension \alpha.

Tsft is the internal chunk time size.  Reduce it to decrease latency.
nTsft is the number of chunks made.  200000 x 30 secs > 2 months
Leave f0 and the band unchanged, and sigma at zero.

Aplus and Across set the amplitude of the two polarizations.  This is
where you can insert an amplitude calibration factor.

The only other value to note is phi.  This is where you can insert a
phase calibration offset, if needed.  Note: phi is NOT scaled by a
factor of two.  In other words, if you set phi=PI, you'll find the
output inverted.  If you set phi=PI/2, you'll see the output phase
retarted.  In other words, the peak of a particular cycle occurs one
quarter of a cycle EARLIER.

To see this clearly, just do something like:

./s3inject -n 1 -G 751680013 -T | head -100 > junk1

Then change the value of phi0 in Pulsar.0, and do it again:

./s3inject -n 1 -G 751680013 -T | head -100 > junk2

Comparing junk1 and junk2 should make the sign convention of phi0 very
clear.

[7] HOW TO USE IT - CALIBRATION LINES

The s3inject executable can inject up to three calibration
lines.  Here they are denoted by L==low, M==medium and H==high to
indicate the frequency.  They are defined by:

  DARM = A_L sin(2 pi f_L (GPS-GPS_0)) +
         A_M sin(2 pi f_M (GPS-GPS_0)) +
         A_H sin(2 pi f_H (GPS-GPS_0))

where GPS_0 = 751680013.  In the code, the frequencies are hardwired to:

  f_L = 52.296875 = 52+1/4+1/32+1/64 Hz
  f_M = 166.6875  = 166+1/2+1/8+1/16 Hz
  f_H = 927.6875  = 927+1/2+1/8+1/16 Hz

These can be changed, but (1) MUST be exactly represented as IEEE754
floats (not doubles) and (2) MUST be positive.

The amplitudes of the injected lines are defined by three arguments (-L, -M and -H) to
s3inject which set the amplitudes of the three lines.  The arguments are, for example:

./s3inject -n 0 -T  -G 12345678 -L 17.76 | more

will inject a calibration line at low frequency with an amplitude of
17.76.  You can include any combination of -L, -M and -H.  If one of
these arguments is not present, then its assumed amplitude is zero.

You can inject five pulsars plus three calibration lines with:
./s3inject -n 5 -L 0.003 -M 0.0006 -H 0.8 -G 751680013 -T | more

Note: a good check that the calibration line injection code works
correctly is to compare the output with GPS times offset by integer
multiples of 64 seconds.  Since the smallest fractional part of the
frequencies above is 1/64 Hz, the calibration signal should repeat
exactly every 64 seconds.

The '-p' option to s3inject prints out the built-in
calibration line frequencies.

[8] COMMENTS

I've tried to make s3inject fairly robust.  In particular,
it catches SIGCHLD and if a child has been terminated (rather than
just being stopped) it tries to say why.  System related errors print
errno and it's interpretation.  Most error messages should come with a
PID to help figure out which process is going bad.

Note that under Solaris, the pid returned with these error messages
appears to be the PID of the shell (started by popen) under which the
child was started.  This is usually one less than the PID of the
associated makefakedata_v2 process.

If you send SIGUSR1 to s3inject:
kill -SIGUSR1 PID
then it will report to stderr the amount of simulated data that it has
made (days/hours/minutes/seconds). Be careful NOT to send the signal
to the entire process group, since the children don't catch this
signal and will respond to it by terminating!


The s3inject program can be used to inject signals from sources OTHER
than pulsars.  To use it in this way, your code must do the following:

(1) write data to stdout, errors to stderr

(2) take a command line argument which is GPS seconds and start its
    output at that time:
    -G secs

(3) be able to run faster than real time under solaris.  It should
produce data at a sample rate of 16384 Hz in blocks of an integer
number of seconds (called S below).

(4) have the following internal structure.  Here S is the number of
seconds, for example, 30, that your code uses internally to compute
the next block of output.

main() {

    float magic=1234.5;
    int length=S*16384;

    fwrite(&magic,  sizeof(float), 1, stdout);
    fwrite(&length, sizeof(int)  , 1, stdout);

    while (1) {
	compute next output data.  May be time-consuming.

        fwrite(&data, sizeof(float), len, stdout);

        fflush(stdout);
    }
}

The fflush(stdout) is VERY important.  It ensures that your program
will have time to compute its next block of data BEFORE it is needed
by s3 inject.

(5) create an in.N file for your executable.  See description above.

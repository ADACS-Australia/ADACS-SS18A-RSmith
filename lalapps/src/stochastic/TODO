TODO:

stochastic.c:

* implement software injections for preforming monte carlo simulations

* rewrite frequency mask code to enable general frequency masks to be
  applied, not just multiples of 16 and 60 Hz

* add loop over frequency band for bayesian search within stochastic.c,
  so that all bands can be analysed without rereading all the data in
	for each band

stopp.c:

* add support for combining statistics form overlapping hann windows

General:

* XLALify core SGWB routines

* add examples of .ini files for running searchs at CIT, LHO, LLO, etc.

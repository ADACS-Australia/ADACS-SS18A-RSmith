TODO:

stochastic.c:

* implement software injections for preforming monte carlo simulations

* rewrite frequency mask code to enable general frequency masks to be
  applied, not just multiples of 16 and 60 Hz

* add loop over frequency band for bayesian search within stochastic.c,
  so that all bands can be analysed without rereading all the data in
	for each band

stopp.c:

* add support for combining statistics from overlapping hann windows

* modularise

stochastic_pipe.in/stochastic_bayes.in:

* unify stochastic_pipe.in and stochastic_bayes.in into a single script

* call lalapps_stopp for each frequency band to create a single xml file
  for each frequency band, for the bayesian search

* specify the LDRdataFindServer in the config file

* enable support for GEO/LIGO correlations, script currently checks for
  calibration information for all detectors - which GEO doesn't need

General:

* XLALify core SGWB routines

Done:

* add examples of .ini files for running searchs at CIT, LHO, LLO,
  etc... (20050507)

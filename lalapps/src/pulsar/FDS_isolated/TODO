TODO (ComputeFStatistic-related)
-----
* get rid of "coordinate-cut" limitations... (->LALNormalizeSkyPosition)

* get rid of year-specification on command-line if possible (use ranges 00-04..)

* quick-fix for mesh-covering problem at the equator?

* clarify priorities between specifying Alpha+AlphaBand.. and a skyRegion

* metric-stuff
	- debug, compare

* work on more general tiling

* modify ComputeFStat so that the search parameters can be refered to
  any arbitrary epoch and not just to the epoch of the first sample of the
  analyzed data set (as is now).

* allow Coherent-metric to use either Ptolemaic-timing or precise timing-routines
  (introduce new metric-type?)

done
----
* use Coherent metric
* deallocate grid-memory
* print grid + metric infos for debugging
* find round-off errors? (-> gcc O2, 1e-5, seems known)
* use config-file
* activate cvs-log for lalapps/pulsar
* write metric wrapper for Ptole and Coherent
* adapt config-file more to python config-syntax
* specify sky-regions by polygon 
* implement new user-variable handling

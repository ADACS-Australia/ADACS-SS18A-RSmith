Pulsar-search in the frequency domain and related codes.
-------------------------------------------------------

ComputeFStatistic: for a summary of the command-line and config-file
		   options, use with the command-line argument
		   "--help" or "-h", and see the file
		   "cfs_example.cfg" for more details.  


FILES:
----------
ComputeFStatistic.h
ComputeFStatistic.c	: main search-code using JKS98 "F-statistic"

clusters.h
clusters.c		: cluster-finding algorithm, very non LAL-compliant

rngmed.h
rngmed.c		: original running-median code, has moved into LAL recently and will disappear soon

DopplerScan.h
DopplerScan.c		: generate grid in parameter-space do stepping through it (eventually -> LAL ?)

cfs_example.cfg		: config-file example for ComputeFStatistic

polka.c			: code that looks for coincidences between two Fstats files 
			  and orders coincident events in decreasing false alarm

ComputeFStatistic_v2.c	: 'placeholder' for work on major re-write of to turn ComputeFStatistic it into 
			   a function callable from other codes (ie. in Monte-Carlo simulations, Hough-search etc)

ComputeFStatisticBinary.h
ComputeFStatisticBinary.c: Chris' modified version to allow for binary-pulsar search. Eventually to be subsumed 
			   into the  main code and to disappear

SemiAnalyticF.h
SemiAnalyticF.c		: Xavier's semi-analytic calculation of F-statistic for testing main-code

FstatShapeTest.c	: Yousuke's codes for Shape-test and finding nearest grid-points...
FstatShapeTestLAL.c	:
NearestGridPoints.c	:     

FrComputeFStatistic.h
FrComputeFStatistic.c	: frame-enabled version of ComputeFStatistic, [currently broken]

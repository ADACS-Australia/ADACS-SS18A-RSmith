/** 
\struct rngmed_val_index
A structure to store values and indices
of elements in an array

\param data Stores a single number 
\param index Stores the original position of the number

This structure is used to track the indices
of elements after sorting by qsort. An array of
rngmed_val_index is passed to qsort which 
rearranges the array according to the values in
the data member. The
indices of these elements in the original unsorted 
array can then be read off from the index member.

TODO
-----
* check source-pos coordinates and "normalize" them if they 
   are 'non-canonical' -> mention in documentation 

* complete LALSignalToSFTs()

* test-check final SFTs against makefakedata_v2

* write some documentation

* understand why we throw away the last freqency-bin in FFT -> SFT ?

* do MEASURE the FFTW-plan, and allow some plan-buffering!

* check if timestamps-ordered == timestamps-delivered... 
	(i.e. timestamps consistent with sampling of time-series?)

done
----

* fix bug of zeroes in beginning/end of time-series
	(-> see makefakedata_v2 for that)
  => used temporary fix now, but really should check LALSimulateCoherentGW()

* turn timestamps completely into INT's for SFTs? (NO)

 *
 * \brief Parameter estimation code for known pulsar searches using the nested sampling algorithm.
 *
 * ### Description ###
 *
 * This code is used to perform parameter estimation and evidence calculation in targeted/semi-targeted searches for
 * gravitational waves from known pulsars. It may also be used to follow-up on signal candidates from semi-coherent all-sky
 * searches for unknown sources.
 *
 * It uses the Bayesian technique of 'Nested Sampling' to sample over a defined prior parameter space (unknown signal
 * parameters such as the gravitational wave amplitude). These samples can then be used to create posterior probability
 * density functions of the unknown parameters. The samples are also used to calculate the Bayesian evidence, also known as
 * the marginal likelihood, for a given signal model. This can be compared with other models, in particular the model that
 * the data is described by Gaussian noise alone.
 *
 * As input the code requires time domain data that has been heterodyned using the known (or close to) phase evolution of
 * the pulsar. The time domain input should consist of a three column text file containing the GPS time stamp of the data
 * point, the real part of the heterodyned data and the imaginary part of the heterodyned data, e.g.
 * 900000000.000000  1.867532e-24  -7.675329e-25
 * 900000060.000000  2.783651e-24  3.654386e-25
 * ...
 *
 * Most commonly such data will have a sample rate of 1/60 Hz, giving a bandwidth of the same amount, but the code can
 * accept any rate.
 *
 * The code also requires that you specify which parameters are to be searched over, and the prior ranges over these. Any
 * of the signal parameters can be searched over, including frequency, sky position and binary system parameters, although
 * the bandwidth of the data and search efficiency need to be taken into account.
 *
 * The 'Nested Sampling' algorithm (developed by \cite Skilling2006) used is that defined in LALinferenceNestedSampler
 * (see \cite VeitchVecchio2010). It is essentially an efficient way to perform the integral
 * \f[
 * Z = \int^{\mathbf{\theta}} p(d|\mathbf{\theta}) p(\mathbf{\theta}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\theta},
 * \f]
 * where \f$ \mathbf{\theta} \f$ is a vector of parameters, \f$ p(d|\mathbf{\theta}) \f$ is the likelihood of the data
 * given the parameters, and \f$ p(\mathbf{\theta}) \f$ is the prior on the parameters. It does this by changing the
 * multi-dimensional integral over N parameters into a one-dimensional integral
 * \f[
 * Z = \int^X L(X) \mathrm{d}X \approx \sum_i L(X_i) \Delta{}X_i,
 * \f]
 * where \f$ L(X) \f$ is the likelihood, and \f$ X \f$ is the prior mass. The algorithm will draw a number (\f$ N \f$) of
 * samples (live points) from the parameter priors, calculate the likelihood for each point and find the lowest likelihood
 * value. The lowest likelihood value will be added to the summation in the above equation, with \f$ \log{\Delta{}X_i}
 * \approx 1/N \f$ coming from the fact that the prior would be normalised to unity and therefore each point should occupy
 * an equal fraction and at each iteration the prior volume will decrease geometrically (for \f$\log{\Delta{}X_0} = 0\f$).
 * A new point is then drawn from the prior with the criterion that it has a higher likelihood than the previous lowest
 * point and substitutes that point. To draw the new point a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure is used - there are
 * two methods used to sample points within this: i) drawing from a proposal distributions based on the covariance matrix
 * if the current live points (although to keep things computationally efficient this no updated at every iteration), ii)
 * picking a point via differential evolution (two random live points are selected and a new point half way between the two
 * is created). The probability of using either method is currently set at 80\% and 20\% respectively. The procedure is
 * continued until a stopping criterion is reached, which in this case is that the remaining prior volume is less than the
 * \c tolerance value set (see below). The implementation of this can be seen in \cite VeitchVecchio2010 .
 *
 * ### Usage ###
 *
 * The usage format is given below and can also be found by running the code with
 * \code
 * lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested --help
 * \endcode
 *
 * An example of running the code on to search over the four unknown parameters \f$ h_0 \f$, \f$ \phi_0 \f$, \f$ \psi \f$
 * and \f$ \cos{\iota} \f$, for pulsar J0534-2200, given heterodyned time domain data from the H1 detector in the file
 * \c finehet_J0534-2200_H1, is:
 * \code
 * lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested --detectors H1 --par-file
 * J0534-2200.par --input-files finehet_J0534-2200_H1 --outfile ns_J0534-2200
 * --prior-file prior_J0534-2200.txt --ephem-earth
 * lscsoft/share/lalpulsar/earth05-09.dat --ephem-sun
 * lscsoft/share/lalpulsar/sun05-09.dat --model-type triaxial --Nlive 1000 --Nmcmc
 * 100 --Nruns 1 --tolerance 0.25
 * \endcode
 * The \c par-file is a TEMPO-style file containing the parameters of the pulsar used to perform the heterodyne (the
 * frequency parameters are the rotation frequency and therefore not necessarily the gravitational wave frequency) e.g.
 * \code
 * RA      12:54:31.87523895
 * DEC     -54:12:43.6572033
 * PMRA    1.7
 * PMDEC   2.8
 * POSEPOCH 54320.8531
 * F0  123.7896438753
 * F1  4.592e-15
 * PEPOCH 54324.8753
 * \endcode
 * The \c prior-file is a text file containing a list of the parameters to be searched over, the prior type ("uniform" or
 * "gaussian" and their given lower/mean and upper/standard deviation ranges e.g.
 * \code
 * h0 uniform 0 1e-21
 * phi0 uniform 0 6.283185307179586
 * cosiota uniform -1 1
 * psi uniform -0.785398163397448 0.785398163397448
 * \endcode
 * Note that if searching over frequency parameters the ranges specified in the \c prior-file should be given in terms of
 * the pulsars rotation frequency and not necessarily the gravitational wave frequency e.g. for a triaxial star emitting
 * gravitational waves at 100 Hz (which will be at twice the rotation frequency) if you wanted to search over 99.999 to
 * 100.001 Hz then you should used
 * \code
 * f0 49.9995 50.0005
 * \endcode
 *
 * An example of running the code as above, but this time on fake data created using the Advanced LIGO design noise curves
 * and with a signal injected into the data is:
 * \code
 * lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested --fake-data AH1 --inject-file
 * fake.par --par-file fake.par --outfile ns_fake --prior-file prior_fake.txt
 * --ephem-earth lscsoft/share/lalpulsar/earth05-09.dat --ephem-sun
 * lscsoft/share/lalpulsar/sun05-09.dat --model-type triaxial --Nlive 1000 --Nmcmc
 * 100 --Nruns 1 --tolerance 0.25
 * \endcode
 * In this case the \c inject-file parameter file must contain the values of \c h0, \c phi0, \c psi and \c cosiota,
 * otherwise these will be set to zero by default. The parameter files given for \c inject-file and \c par-file do not
 * have to be the same - the injection can be offset from the 'heterodyned' values, which will be reflected in the data. If
 * an \c inject-output file is also specified then the fake data containing the signal, and a fake signal-only data set,
 * will be output.

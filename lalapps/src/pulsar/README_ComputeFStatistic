ComputeFStatistic calculates the F-statistic (as defined by Jaronowski, Krolak 
and Schutz, PRD 58:063001,1998) from a collection of GEO-format binary SFTs.

The command-line arguments it takes are:

	-f	FLOAT	 Starting search frequency in Hz (not set by default)
	-b	FLOAT	 Demodulation frequency band in Hz (set=0.0 by default)
	-r	FLOAT	 Demodulation frequency resolution in Hz (set to 1/Tobs by default)
	-t	INTEGER	 Number of terms to keep in Dirichlet kernel sum (default 16)
	-a	FLOAT	 Sky position alpha (equatorial coordinates) in radians (default 0.0)
	-d	FLOAT	 Sky position delta (equatorial coordinates) in radians (default 0.0)
	-D	STRING	 Directory where SFT's are located (not set by default) 
	-E	STRING	 Directory where Ephemeris files are located (not set by default) 
	-I	STRING	 Detector; must be set to 0=GEO, 1=LLO, 2=LHO or 3=Roman Bar (not set by default) 
	-n	STRING	 Noise only; must be set to 0=Regular data, 1=Signal only data (default 0) 
	-s	INTEGER	 Spindown order (default 1) 
	-1	FLOAT	 1st spindown parameter (default 0.0)
	-2	FLOAT	 2nd spindown parameter (default 0.0)
	-3	FLOAT	 3rd spindown parameter (default 0.0)
	-4	FLOAT	 4th spindown parameter (default 0.0)

All arguments not set by default need to be set by the user or the program will exit.
To my knowledge the program will segfault only if the information in the ephemeris files
is incorrect (this actually needs to be fixed.  The ephemeris filenames (but not the path) 
are hardwired into the code and are currently earth02.dat and sun02.dat.

Included in this directoty are also 10 60s SFTs starting at 714153733.  They are signal 
only and span the 4Hz band 1008Hz-1012Hz. The signal is at a frequency of 1010.7Hz with 
no spindown parameters, and alpha=delta=0, A_+=1, A_x=0, Psi=0, phi0=0. They are produced
according to what the signal would look like from the GEO IFO.

The command:

./ComputeFStatistic -D ./ -f 1010.7 -I 0 -E ../ -n 1

Should produces the output:
 
     1010.7000000000    2.178901298971842

(which is correct to about 0.3%)

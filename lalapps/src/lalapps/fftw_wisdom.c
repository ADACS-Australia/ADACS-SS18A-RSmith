 *  \brief Utility to create double-precision FFTW wisdom files
 *
 *  This utility is designed to serve as a replacement for the utility fftw-wisdom that
 *  comes with FFTW.  It will generate only the kind of plans that LAL supports, as well
 *  as a detailed, human readable description of those plans that is sent to stdout.  This
 *  description can then be saved so that the user knows what transforms are included in
 *  the wisdom file (which is not itself human-readable).
 *
 *  The transforms to be planned must be specified in an input file, with one transform
 *  per line.  The format is:
 *
 *  <type><direc><size>
 *
 *  where:
 *
 *  - <type>     may be 'c' for a complex transform, or 'r' for a real transform
 *  - <direc>    may be 'f' for a forward transform, or either 'r' or 'b' for a reverse or
 *               backward transform. The latter two are equivalent; the dual notation is
 *               designed to support both the 'backward' terminology of FFTW and the
 *               'reverse' terminology of LAL.
 *  - <size>     is the size of the desired transform.
 *
 *  Both the <type> and <direc> specifiers are insensitive to case.
 *
 *  The invocation must also specify an output file, where the wisdom itself will be
 *  written.  You may redirect stdout to save the human-readable description. This should
 *  always be APPENDED to the human readable description of any existing wisdom files
 *  (system or otherwise) that were read in as part of the execution; there is no way
 *  for lalapps_fftw_wisdom to print out the human readable description of any existing
 *  wisdom read in.
 *
 *  So, as an example, suppose that there is an existing system-wide file in
 *  /etc/fftw/wisdom, and that its human readable description is
 *  /etc/fftw/wisdom_description.  Then if there is presently no plan for a complex,
 *  reverse transform of size 1048576 (or 2^20), then put the line:
 *
 *  cb1048576
 *
 *  into the file input_plans (say) and run:
 *
 *        cp /etc/fftw/wisdom_description new_description
 *
 *        lalapps_fftw_wisdom -i input_plans -o new_wisdom -l 3 >> new_description
 *
 *  When this has finished you can (as root) move new_wisdom to /etc/fftw/wisdom and
 *  new_description to /etc/fftw/wisdom_description.  The same results could also be
 *  achieved by specifying any of cr1048576, CB1048576, etc, in input_plans.
 *
 *  Aside from the options specifying input and output files (which are mandatory) there
 *  are three other optional arguments.  They are:
 *
 *  - -n or --no-system-wisdom  This disables reading in /etc/fftw/wisdom.  Use this only
 *    if you do NOT want the wisdom there to be incorporated into the wisdom file you generate
 *    (for instance, if it is outdated because of hardware or FFTW library change). In such a
 *    case you should also not append to the existing human readable description, but replace it.
 *  - -w <FILE> or --wisdom=<FILE>  Read in existing wisdom from <FILE>.  Program exits if this
 *    option is given but the corresponding file is not readable. As with the system wisdom, you
 *    should append to a human readable description of the wisdom in this file; what is there
 *    already will not be descirbed in the output of lalapps_fftw_wisdom.
 *  - -l <int> or --measurelvl=<int>  The planning measure level used in creating the plans.
 *    Defaults to 3 (exhaustive) if not given.  Levels 0 or 1 (estimate and measure, respectively)
 *    are possible, but not appropriate for a system-wide wisdom file, as plans of those levels
 *    can be efficiently generated on the fly in application code. Level 3 (exhaustive) is the
 *    highest level and would normally be expected to give the best performance, though for large
 *    transform sizes it can take hours or even days to create the plans.  The human readable
 *    description of the generated wisdom will note the measure level at which it was created.
 *
 *  \note All of the human readable descriptions will also indicate that the wisdom was created
 *        with FFTW_UNALIGNED.  Users unfamiliar with this may safely ignore it; all LAL plans
 *        are presently created with this flag.  The notation is there in case that should change
 *        at some point in the future, so that the record of the created wisdom preserves the
 *        distinction.

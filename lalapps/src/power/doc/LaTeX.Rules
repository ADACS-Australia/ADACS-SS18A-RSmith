# Example Makefile for a LaTeX file called "article.tex":
#
# === begin Makefile ===
#
# LATEX := pdflatex
# DOCUMENT := article
#
# include LaTeX.Rules
#
# === end Makefile ===
#
# Then run
#	$ make [target]
#
# The following targets are understood:
#	dvi		generate dvi output (latex default target)
#	pdf             generate pdf output (pdflatex default target)
#	ps		generate postscript
#	mostlyclean	erase all intermediate files
#	clean		erase all but the source files
#
# To do:
#	-recursively process \include{} and \input{} commands for .tex
#	dependancies
#	-do the same for \bibliography{} commands
#	-add metapost processing
#

#
# Document information (these are variables you can set in the Makefile
# in which this file is being included)
#
# LATEX
#	The name of the latex compiler to use.  If the program name is,
#	specifically, "pdflatex" then the .pdf will be the default target
#	rather than the .dvi.  Note that at present there is no way to ask
#	for one or the other without switching the contents of this
#	variable.
#
# DOCUMENT
#	(required) The root name for all files.
#
# GRAPHIC_FILES
#	Any graphic files the document depends on, for example any .eps or
#	.pdf files included with \includegraphics{}.  The output is rebuilt
#	if any of these files change but otherwise they play no role in the
#	build process.
#
# TEXT_FILES
#	Any text files the document depends on, for example any files that get
#	included via \verbatiminput{} commands.  The output is rebuilt if any
#	of these files change, but otherwise they play no role in the build
#	process.
#
# MPOST_FILES
#	Any MetaPost .mp files the document depends on.  NOTE:  do *not*
#	list .mp files generated by Embedded MetaPost.
#
# XFIG_FILES
#	Thes Makefile rules allow your LaTeX document to include XFig .fig
#	files directly.  Each .fig file is converted to a graphic format
#	suitable for inclusion by the LaTeX processor, for example
#	postscript or pdf.  This is accomplished by processing the .fig
#	file with fig2dev and producing two output files:  a graphics
#	version of the .fig file and a LaTeX source file containing the
#	commands needed to import that graphics file.  In your own LaTeX
#	document, you will need to include this .tex source file.  For
#	example, if you have an XFig file called diagram.fig, you should
#	set "XFIG_FILES = diagram.fig" in your Makefile and place the
#	command "\include{diagram.fig}" in your LaTeX document where you
#	would like the image placed.  When your document is processed, the
#	XFig file will be converted to a, for example, postscript file
#	called diagram.fig.ps and a LaTeX source file called
#	diagram.fig.tex.  The \include{} command in your LaTeX source reads
#	in the .fig.tex file (the .tex extension is assumed by the command)
#	which in turn contains the commands to import the graphics file.
#
#	As an added bonus, any text objects in the XFig document that have
#	their "special" flag set will be removed from the document before
#	it is converted to a graphics format.  Their contents are added to
#	the LaTeX source file along with the commands needed to overlay
#	them in the correct places on the figure.  In this way, you can use
#	LaTeX to typset the text of your XFig figure.  This has the
#	advantage of having the text rendered in the same font as the rest
#	of your document and also allows you to make use of all of LaTeX's
#	typsetting facilities.  Note that in your XFig document you should
#	set the pen colour of the "special" text to "Default" in order to
#	prevent \color commands from being issued, otherwise you will need
#	to include the LaTeX package "color".
#
#	If you get error messages about "unknown graphics format" related
#	to the .fig.ps or .fig.pdf intermediate graphics file then you must
#	issue the \DeclareGraphicsRule{.fig.ps}{eps}{.fig.ps}{} command or
#	the \DeclareGraphicsRule{.fig.pdf}{pdf}{.fig.pdf}{} command in your
#	document's preamble.  See the grfguide.ps graphics package
#	documentation for more information.
#
# BIB_FILES
#	$(DOCUMENT).tex will be automatically searched for all .bib files
#	specified via \bibliography{} commands.  Use this variable to
#	override the automatic search and manually specify the .bib files.
#	Reasons for wanting to override the automatics:  (i) scanning a
#	large document can be time-consuming and can be skipped by entering
#	the info yourself (ii) the algorithm may be broken for your
#	document.
#
# BBL_FILES
# 	bibtex produces .bbl files as output from the .aux and .bib files,
# 	and LaTeX will include its contents in subsequence passes.  By
# 	default, the name of the .bbl file is $(DOCUMENT).bbl, but you can
# 	manually override that default by setting the value of this
# 	variable to a non-empty string before including this rules file.
#
# BSTINPUTS
# BIBINPUTS
#	The contents of these variables override the system default search
#	paths for bibtex.  If you are using a custom bibliographic style,
#	you may need to set BSTINPUTS to the directory in which the .bst
#	file resides.  If your .bib databases cannot be found, then you
#	will need to set BIBINPUTS to a colon-separated list of the
#	directories in which they reside.
#
# DVIPS_FLAGS
#	Flags to pass to dvips.  It might be necessary to include the -K
#	flag if you are having trouble getting mpage to handle documents
#	that contain EPS figures generated by certain applications.

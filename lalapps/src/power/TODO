Condor scripts:
==============

+  bring new script up to the same level as the old ones
        - add a lalapps_binj node to the dag and to the script

*  Write a DAG script to handle S3 analysis
        - should be able to handle all double, trip, quad data
        - use science master segments then handle overlaps downstream
        

Power tasks:
============

+  Modify to use call to LALComputeSpectrum() instead of in-line code
+  Add ability to resample the data following inspiral code
+  Fix threshold computing codes (PATRICK)
+  Make sure that frame reading code does not drop times

*  Add ability to output spectrum, etc. as frames
*  Add ability to output hrss for the burst triggers found (PATRICK)
*  Check that all search summary information works correctly
*  Add clustering algorithms suggested by PRB & JDEC
        - cluster by peak (central) time of tiles
        - Jolien's suggestion (cannot remember right now)

o  Make sure can filter auxilliary channels
o  Fix injection codes to be able to take arbitrary signals
        - this is a substantial job,  needs a couple of weeks
	- could plan to work with h(t) for now
 

burca tasks:
============

*  Make sure it provided search summary information
*  Enhance in line with the method used for inca
*  Time-slide capability
*  Should be able to handle injection verification efficiency work


bread/binj_find tasks:
=====================

*  unify these codes so that we don't have to maintain both
*  enhance binj_find to find best match out of triggers
*  add the ability to 


multiPower:
==========

*  Develop a code to do multi-detector power searches
*  Should be easy given all our current experience


Burst-inspiral coincidence:
==========================

*  Write code to do burst inspiral coincidence

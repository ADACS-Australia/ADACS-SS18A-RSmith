Power tasks:
============

+  Add ability to resample the data following inspiral code
+  Fix threshold computing codes (PATRICK)
+  Make sure that frame reading code does not drop times

*  Add ability to output spectrum, etc. as frames
*  Add ability to output hrss for the burst triggers found (PATRICK)

o  Make sure can filter auxilliary channels
o  Fix injection codes to be able to take arbitrary signals
        - this is a substantial job,  needs a couple of weeks
	- could plan to work with h(t) for now


multiPower:
==========

*  Develop a code to do multi-detector power searches
*  Should be easy given all our current experience


Burst-inspiral coincidence:
==========================

*  Write code to do burst inspiral coincidence

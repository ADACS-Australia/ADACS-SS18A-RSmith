* expand DAG to include generation of summary information
* expand DAG to include clustering and coincidence step


Power code tasks:
================

*  Move the output to the end of power.c
*  Add proctable to power.c
*  Add ability to notch out lines
*  Add ability to output spectrum, etc.
*  Add ability to read in the calibration data
*  Add ability to read in injection files
*  Add ability to inject into data
*  Add ability to output calibrated power in band
  

snglBurstHistogram:
==================

*  Modify time-freq output to produce 3-d plot
*  Add ability to parse the xml files when proctable is present


sngBurstCoincidence:
===================

*  Add a code which takes three xml files & looks for coincidence

Condor scripts:
==============

* use a DAG to submit jobs to the cluster
* expand DAG to include generation of summary information
* expand DAG to include clustering and coincidence step


Power code tasks:
================

*  Move the output to the end of power.c  [Testing]
*  Add proctable to power.c  [Testing]
*  Add ability to notch out lines  [Testing]
*  Add ability to output spectrum, etc.
*  Add ability to read in the calibration data
*  Add ability to read in injection files
*  Add ability to inject into data
*  Add ability to output calibrated power in band
  

snglBurstHistogram:
==================

*  Modify time-freq output to produce 3-d plot [Done]
*  Add ability to parse the xml files when proctable is present [Done]


sngBurstCoincidence:
===================

*  Add a code which takes three xml files & looks for coincidence
*  Enhance code to do sensible clustering (difficult)
*  Enhance code to check freq coincidence
*  Enhance code to check amplitude consistency


multiPower:
==========

*  Develop a code to do multi-detector power searches


burstInjections:
===============

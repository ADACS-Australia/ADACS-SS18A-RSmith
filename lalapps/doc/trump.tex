\item[Name]
\verb$lalapps_trump$ --- produces an trumpd display showing the time
series output of a selected channel in a lower window, and a simultaneously
calculated FFT power spectrum in the upper window

\item[Synopsis]
\verb$lalapps_trump$ [\verb$--help$] [\verb$--veto$ \textit{filename}] 
[\verb$--trigger$ \textit{filename}] [\verb$--times$ \textit{filename}
\textit{safety}] [\verb$-o$ \textit{outfile}] 
[\verb$--coincidence$ \textit{file1} \textit{file2} \textit{dt}]

\item[Description]
\verb$lalapps_trump$ manipulates the results of the inspiral search code
and veto data stored in XML format to produce lists of candidate
events for individual interferometers.   It can also be used to
perform a coincidence analysis using the output written for each
interferometer.  

\item[Options]\leavevmode
\begin{entry}
\item[\texttt{--help}]
Print a help message.
\item[\texttt{--veto} \textit{filename}]
Name of the file containing metadata about the vetos to be applied to
inspiral triggers.   This file can contain multiple lines.  Each line
has the format:
\begin{quote}
\textit{name};\textit{filename};\textit{column};\textit{threshold};\textit{duration}
\end{quote}
Here \textit{name} is a character string;  \textit{filename} is a
character string naming the xml file with the veto triggers;
\textit{column} is the database column name to use for veto
construction;  \textit{threshold} is a real number,  vetos have the
value in \textit{column} bigger than this; \textit{duration} is a real
number corresponding to the number of seconds to ignore around the
veto trigger.

\end{entry}

\item[Example]
To run the program,  type:
\begin{verbatim}
lalapps_trump --channel H2:LSC-AS_Q --framedir ./h1 --numpts 16384 \
--epoch 693768272 0 --duration 1 --highpass 300 0.01 | xmgr -pipe
\end{verbatim}
This will search in directory \verb$./h1$ for frame files containing
the channel \verb$H2:LSC-AS_Q$ and pipe the data starting at 693768272
GPS seconds and 0 GPS nanonseconds to xmgr in segments containing 16384 
points until 1 seconds of data has been reviewed.  The data is highpass 
filtered to above 300 Hz with an attenuation of $0.1$;  the output is
shown in Fig.~\ref{f:trump}

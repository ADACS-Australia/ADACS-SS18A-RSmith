\chapter{Inspiral Search Programs}
\label{chapter:inspiral}

This section of \textsc{LALApps} contains programs that can be used to search
interferometer data for inspiral signals using templated matched filtering and
associated veto strategies.

\section{Description of the Components of the Pipeline}

A short description of each possible part of the inspiral pipeline follows. 
The more detailed description of each command-line argument can be found in 
the specific pages for each part of the code.

\subsection{Template Bank Generation}

\texttt{lalapps\_tmpltbank}: Generates a template bank for an analysis
chunk of LIGO or GEO data. The bank can be for any of the different kinds of
inspiral signals: TaylorF2, BCV etc.

The code generates a calibrated power spectrum for the "analysis chunk"
determined by the specified start and 
end times and for the requested channel. The number of templates and the
values of the bank parameters in the bank also depend on the minimal 
match, the
minimum and maximum values of mass1 and mass2 (for the BNS search) or the 
minimum and maximum values of psi0, psi3, the bank-alpha and the number of
fcut values (for the BCV search), which are all command-line arguments.
Other necessary pieces of information are the approximant and its order and
the space that the template bank will be laid on. The output of the code is
an xml file and the bank is contained in a \verb$sngl_inspiral$ table. The code has
also the capability of outputing the raw data, the response function and the 
calibrated and unclibrated power spectra to frame files.

\subsection{Matched Filtering and Injections}

\texttt{lalapps\_inspiral}: Performs matched filtering for inspiral signals on
LIGO or GEO data; it also has the capability of doing software signal injections on 
the data.

The length of data on which the filtering is performed is specified by the start and end
times. That length can be thought of as an "analysis chuck" of data.
The data can be high passed if a frequency, a filter order and the
attenuation are specified. Also, the analysis chunk can be split into a number of
segments of equal duration and of a certain overlap, for power spectrum
estimation and for the actual filtering.
Some command line arguments that need to be specified are the approximant to
be used for the filtering, the number of chi-squared bins, the chi-square and
signal-to-noise ratio thresholds. It is also necessary that an
xml file that contains the template bank that  
has been generated by \verb$lalapps\_tmpltbank$ be specified as a command line 
argument.

The output is an xml file that contains a
\verb$sngl\_inspiral$ table for the triggers and additional tables with
information about how the code was run.

There is also the capability of outputting the raw data before and after the
injections, the response function, the uncalibrated power spectrum, the snr
and the chisq time series, all in frame files.

\subsection{Triggered Template Bank, Trigger Coincidence and Time Slides}

\texttt{lalapps\_inca}: Currently performs three different tasks:

Triggered template bank generation: Given the triggers from one interferometer
in a \verb$sngl\_inspiral$ table, it generates a triggered tempalte bank to be
used in filtering the data from a second interferometer.

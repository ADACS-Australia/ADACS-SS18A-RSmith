LGEN: LSC Graphics Engine

LGEn is a collection of utilities for plotting the ooutput files from LSC
analysis pipelines

This README file explains how to build and install LGEn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Prerequisites

LGEn needs matplotlib and numarray to provide plotting and good
scientific data manipulation.  The LIGO lightweigth reading stuff
requires LAL, Metaio and Python.  At the present time,  you must 
hack setupext.py to get it to compile.


1. Determine your Python version

Python version 2.2 or greater is required to install LGEn. Type:

  python -V

to determine the version of python installed on your machine. For example:

  [duncan@contra lalapps]$ python -V
  Python 2.2.2

On some operating systems (e.g. Red Hat 7.3) the program named python runs
python version 1 and the version 2 executable is named python2. If python -V
does not return 2.2 or greater, type:

  python2 -V

For example:

  [dbrown@neutron dbrown]$ python2 -V
  Python 2.3

If you do not have version 2.2 or greater installed, contact your system
administrator for help installing Python.

Set the environment variable PYTHON to be the name of your python version 2
executable. For example if your executable is named python, bash or sh users
should type:

  export PYTHON=python

and csh users should type:

  setenv PYTHON python

If your executable is named python2, bash or sh users should type:

  export PYTHON=python2

and csh users should type:

  setenv PYTHON python2


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Get LGEn from CVS

First choose a directory in which to install the LGEn sources. In this
example, we install the sources into ${HOME}/src. If you decide to install
somewhere else, change ${HOME}/src to the directory you have chosen. Change
anonymous in the cvs checkout below to your lscsoft CVS user name, if you have
one. Type:

  mkdir -p ${HOME}/src
  cd ${HOME}/src
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@gravity.phys.uwm.edu:2402/usr/local/cvs/lscsoft checkout lsware

This will create a directory ${HOME}/src/lsware/lgen containing the LGEn sources.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Build and Install LGEn

Choose a location in which to install LGEn. In this example we choose
/opt/lgen. You must have write access to this directory, so you may wish to
install in ${HOME}, for example. Set the environment variable ${LGEN_LOCATION}
to point to your chosen install directory. Bash or sh users should type:

  export LGEN_LOCATION=/opt/lgen

and csh users should type:

  setenv LGEN_LOCATION /opt/lgen

Assuming you have installed the lgen sources in ${HOME}/src/lgen, type:

  cd ${HOME}/src/lsware/lgen

Now edit setupext.py so that include_dirs and library_dirs have the 
directory paths for your setup,  then type:

  ${PYTHON} setup.py install --home=${LGEN_LOCATION}

This will build and install all the LGEn modules and programs.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Set up your Environment for Using LGEn

If you are a bash or sh user, edit your .profile (or .bash_profile) file and
add the lines (changing /opt/lgen to wherever you installed LGEn):

  export LGEN_LOCATION=/opt/lgen
  if [ -f ${LGEN_LOCATION}/etc/lgen-user-env.sh ] ; then
    source ${LGEN_LOCATION}/etc/lgen-user-env.sh
  fi

If you are a csh user, edit your .login file and add the lines (changing
/opt/lgen to wherever you installed LGEn):

  setenv LGEN_LOCATION /opt/lgen
  if ( -f ${LGEN_LOCATION}/etc/lgen-user-env.csh ) then
    source ${LGEN_LOCATION}/etc/lgen-user-env.csh
  endif

Now log out and log back in to ensure that all environment variables have been
updated. 

You may now use LGEn! Please report any problems via the Gnats database linked
from the LGEn home page.

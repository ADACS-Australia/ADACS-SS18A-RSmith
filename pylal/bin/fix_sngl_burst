# Convert a LIGO LW file containing sngl_burst tables as generated by LAL
# to a format compatible with the official LSC table definition.  This
# means: renaming the peak_dof column to tfvolume, deleting the clusterT
# column, and removing and then adding (valid) event_ids.  Reads input from
# stdin, writes output to stdout.

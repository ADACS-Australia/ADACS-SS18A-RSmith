\brief Module to calculate the RHS of the differential equations
in Eq.\eqref{eq_ode2}.

\heading{Prototypes}

<tt>LALInspiralDerivatives()</tt>:
<ul>
<li> \c values: Input containing the values of the variables \f$v\f$ and \f$\phi\f$ at the
current time.</li>
<li> \c dvalues: Output containing the derivatives \f$dv/dt\f$ and \f$d\phi/dt\f$ at the
current time.</li>
<li> \c params: Input  of type \c InspiralDerivativesIn that must be
cast to a <tt>void.</tt>\\
</li>
</ul>

\heading{Description}

This module calculates the right-hand sides of
the follwoing two coupled first-order differential equations which are
solved to obtain the gravitational wave phasing equation,
as described in the documentation for the function \c LALInspiralWave1:
The equations are
\anchor ode2 \f{equation}{
\frac{dv}{dt} = - \frac{\mathcal{F}(v)}{m E^{\prime}(v)},\ \ \ \
\frac{d \phi(t)}{dt} = \frac{2v^{3}}{m}.
\label{ode2}
\f}

\heading{Algorithm}


\heading{Uses}
None.

\heading{Notes}

<ul>
<li> This function has been intentionally made non-LAL compliant in the sense that it
has no status structure.  This is because this code
outputs the RHS of the differential equations
and is called repeatedly by a function that integrates the two differential
equations and should therefore not suffer from undue overheads.</li>
<li> The input \c params is of type \c InspiralDerivativesIn and must
be cast to a void before calling this function. For example,
<code>
   InspiralDerivativesIn in3;
   void *funcParams;
   in3.totalmass = totalmass;
   ...
   funcParams = (void *) \&in3;
</code>
</li>
</ul>

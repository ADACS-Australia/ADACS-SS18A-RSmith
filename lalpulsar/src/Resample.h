\section{Header \texttt{Resample.h}}
\label{s:Resample.h}

Provides routines for resampling time series according to a new
canonical time coordinate.

\subsection*{Synopsis}
\begin{verbatim}
#include <lal/Resample.h>
\end{verbatim}

\noindent One of the crucial problems in searching for
constant-frequency astrophysical signals is removing the effects of
Doppler modulation due to the Earth's motion.  This is normally
accomplished by constructing a canonical time coordinate $\tau$ of an
inertial frame (i.e.\ the \emph{barycentred time}), and
decimating/resampling the data at fixed intervals in $\tau$.  The
reconstructed $\tau$ depends on the direction to the source relative
to the Earth's motion; in addition, slow intrinsic parameterized
modulations in the source frequency can also be corrected by this
coordinate transformation.

Most of the routines in this module assume that $\tau$ can be
piecewise expanded as a Taylor series in $t$.  That is, one defines a
set of fitting \emph{regions} $T_i=[t_{\mathrm{bound}(i-1)},
t_{\mathrm{bound}(i)}]$, and a set of fitting \emph{points}
$t_{(i)}\in T_i$.  In each region one then writes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tau}
\tau(t) = \sum_{k=0} \frac{1}{k!}c_{k(i)}(t-t_{(i)})^k \; .
\end{equation}
Since one is normally interested in tracking the difference
$\tau(t)-t$, one can also write the expansion as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:delta-tau}
\tau(t)-t = \sum_{k=0} a_{k(i)}(t-t_{(i)})^k \; ,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
a_{0(i)} & = & c_{0(i)}-t_{(i)}           \; , \nonumber\\
a_{1(i)} & = & c_{1(i)}-1                 \; , \nonumber\\
a_{k(i)} & = & c_{k(i)}/k! \; , \; k\geq2 \; . \nonumber
\label{eq:a_c}
\end{eqnarray}
These are the polynomial coefficients normally assumed in the modules
under this header.

The procedure for resampling according to $\tau$ is normally combined
with \emph{decimating} the time series.  That is, one takes a time
series sampled at constant intervals $\Delta t$ in $t$, and samples it
at constant intervals $d\Delta t$ in $\tau$, where the
\emph{decimation factor} $d$ is normally taken to be an integer
$\geq1$.  When $\tau$ and $t$ are drifting out of phase relatively
slowly, this means that most of the time every $d^\mathrm{th}$ sample
in the original time series becomes the next sample in the decimated
time series.  However, when $\tau$ and $t$ drift out of synch by an
amount $\pm\Delta t$, one can force the decimated time series to track
$\tau$ (rather than $t$) by sampling the $d\pm1^\mathrm{th}$ next
datum (rather than the $d^\mathrm{th}$).  If the drift is sufficiently
rapid or $d$ is sufficiently large, one may be forced to choose the
point $d\pm2$, $d\pm3$, etc.; the size of this adjustment is called
the correction \emph{shift}.  The number of (resampled) time intervals
between one correction point and the next is called the correction
\emph{interval}.

Unless otherwise specified, all time variables and parameters in the
functions under this header can be assumed to measure the detector
time coordinate $t$.  Canonical times are specified by giving the
difference $\tau-t$.

\paragraph{Caveat emptor:} The inclusion of this header and its
associated modules into LAL is provisional at this time.  The routines
and the test code appear to work, but a later standalone code,
operating on much larger datasets, appeared to encounter a memory
leak.  I have not yet determined whether this leak was in the
standalone code or in these LAL routines.

\subsubsection*{Structure \texttt{ResampleRules}}
\idx[Type]{ResampleRules}

\noindent This structure stores the rules for taking a time series
$t$, sampled at constant intervals $\Delta t$, and resampling it at
constant intervals $d\Delta t$ in the canonical time coordinate $\tau$,
as described above.  The fields in this structure are as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{LIGOTimeGPS start}] The initial time for which the rules
	apply.

\item[\texttt{LIGOTimeGPS stop}] The final time for which the rules
	apply.

\item[\texttt{INT4 length}] The number of correction points, i.e.\
	points where the resampling interval is adjusted from $d\Delta
	t$ to $(d\pm n)\Delta t$.

\item[\texttt{INT4 *interval}] An array giving the number of resampled
	time intervals between correction points.

\item[\texttt{INT2 *shift}] An array giving the size of the correction
	shift (i.e.\ the number $n$ above) at each correction point.

\item[\texttt{INT4 decimate}] The decimation factor $d$.

\item[\texttt{REAL8 deltaT}] The sampling interval before decimation,
	in seconds.

\item[\texttt{REAL8 startDiff}] The difference $\tau-t$ at the time
	\verb@start@, in seconds.

\item[\texttt{REAL8 stopDiff}] The difference $\tau-t$ at the time
	\verb@stop@, in seconds.

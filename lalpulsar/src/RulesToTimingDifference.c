\subsection{Module \texttt{RulesToTimingDifference.c}}
\label{ss:RulesToTimingDifference.c}

Computes values of the timing difference $(\tau-t)/\Delta t$ from a
set of resampling rules.

\subsubsection*{Description}

These function fills a time series \verb@*difference@ with the values
of the normalized timing difference $(\tau-t)/\Delta t$ between the
detector time $t$ and some canonical time $\tau(t)$, sampled as a
function of $t$.  This is computed using the resampling rules
\verb@*rules@, which specify how one resamples a function of $t$ as a
function of $\tau$.  Note that $\Delta t$ in the formula above is the
raw (unresampled) sampling interval in $t$ used to compute the
resampling rules, \emph{not} necessarily the sampling interval of the
time series.  Thus a shift of $\pm1$ in the resampling rules
corresponds to a change of $\pm1$ in the normalized timing difference.

\subsubsection*{Algorithm}

This routine is quite simple: it increments a time counter
\verb@tNext@ by resampling rule intervals until it finds the next
correction after the current time \verb@t@, accumulating the shifts to
the timing function given by \verb@rules->shift@.  It then increments
\verb@t@ until it steps past \verb@tNext@, each time filling
\verb@difference->data@ with the current value of the cumulative
timing error $(\tau-t)/\Delta t$.  These are iterated until the time
series is completely filled.  Internally, all times are all converted
to units of \verb@rules->deltaT@ and are measured from
\verb@rules->start@.

It is worth noting that a shift in the resampling, as given by
\verb@rules->shift@, adjusts the value of $\tau-t$ by shifting the
current value of $t$.  Thus the difference in \emph{detector} time
between the $n^\mathrm{th}$ and the $(n+1)^\mathrm{th}$ resampling
corrections is (\verb@interval[@$n$\verb@]@$\times$\verb@decimate@ +
\verb@shift[@$n$\verb@]@)$\times\Delta t$, while the difference in
\emph{canonical} time is simply
\verb@interval[@$n$\verb@]@$\times$\verb@decimate@$\times\Delta t$.
Since \verb@*difference@ is assumed to be sampled in detector time
$t$, we use the first of these formulae.

   \brief Routines for building and updating the space of partial
   Hough map derivatives and related functions needed for the construction
   of  total Hough maps at different frequencies and
   possible residual spin down parameters.

   \heading{Synopsis}

   \code
   #include <lal/LALHough.h>
   \endcode

   As we mention before,
   the issue is to build histograms, the Hough map (HM), in the
   parameter space: for each intrinsic frequency  \f$ f_0 \f$, each residual
   spin-down parameter, and each refined sky location inside the patch.
   Notice, from the master equation, that the effect of the residual
   spin-down parameter is just a change in \f$ F_0\f$ , and, at any given
   time, \f$  F_0 \f$ can be considered constant.
   Also, the Hough map is a histogram, thus additive. It can be seen as
   the sum of several partial Hough maps constructed using just one periodogram.

   Therefore, we can construct  the HM for any  \f$ f_0\f$  and spin-down
   value by adding together, at different times, partial Hough maps (PHM)
   corresponding to different \f$ F_0\f$  values (or equivalently, adding their
   derivatives and then integrating the result).

   In practice this means that in order to obtain the HM for a given
   frequency and all possible residual spin-down parameters, we  have to construct
   a CYLINDER of around the frequency \f$ f_0\f$ .   All of the \e phmd coming
   from data demodulated with the same parameters.
   The coordinates of the \e phmd locate the position of the source in
   the sky, and by summing along different directions inside the cylinder we refine
   the spin-down value.
   To analyze another frequency, for all possible spin-down parameters,
   we just need to add a new line to the cylinder (and remove another one, in a
   circular buffer)
   and then proceed making all the possible sums again.

   For the case of only 1 spin-down parameter we have to sum
   following straight lines whose slope is related to the grid in the
   residual spin-down parameter. We can distinguish (at most) as
   many lines as the number of the different periodograms used.

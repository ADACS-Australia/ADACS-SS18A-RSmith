\par Description

 Our goal is the construction of Hough maps. In order to produce them
 efficiently, the present implemetation makes use of <tt>lut</tt>s.
 Here we provide the necessary routines for their construction and use.\\

 In principle, the subroutines provided are valid for
  <i>any</i> Hough master equation of the form:
   \f$ \nu-F_0  =\vec\xi (t) \cdot (\hat n -\hat N )\, ,\f$
 where \f$\nu\f$ is the measured frequency of the signal at time \f$t\f$,
  \f$F_0\f$ intrinsic frequency of the signal at that time, \f$\hat n\f$ location of the
  souce in the sky, \f$\hat N\f$ the center of the sky patch used in the
  demodulation procedure,
   and
  \f$\vec\xi (t)\f$ any vector.

  The  form of this vector \f$\vec\xi (t)\f$
  depends on the demodulation procedure
   used in the previous  step.  In our case this corresponds to
\f$\vec\xi (t) = \left( F_0+
\sum_k F_k \left[ \Delta T  \right]^k\right) \frac{\vec v(t)}{c}
 + \left( \sum_k k F_k \left[ \Delta  T \right]^{k-1}\right)
\frac {\vec x(t)- \vec x(\hat t_0)}{c}\, ,\f$
and
   \f$F_0 \equiv  f_0 + \sum_k \Delta f_k
 \left[ \Delta T \right]^k \, , \f$
 where
 \f$\vec v(t)\f$ is the velocity of the detector, \f$\vec x(t)\f$ is the detector
 position,
 \f$ T_{\hat N}(t)\f$ is the  time  at
 the solar system barycenter (for a given sky
  location \f$\hat N\f$),
   \f$\Delta T \equiv T_{\hat N}(t)-T_{\hat N}(\hat t_0)\f$,
  \f$\Delta f_k = f_k-F_k\f$ the  residual spin-down parameter,
\f$F_k\f$ the  spin-down parameter used in the demodulation, and \f$f_0\f$, \f$f_k\f$ the
intrinsic  frequency and spin-down parameters of the source at time \f$\hat t_0\f$.\\

 Looking at the generic Hough master equation, one realizes that
 for a fixed  time, a given value of \f$F_0\f$, and a measured frequency \f$\nu\f$
  (from a selected peak), the source could be located anywhere on a circle (whose
 center points in the same direction of \f$\vec\xi (t)\f$ and is characterized by
 \f$\phi\f$, the angle between \f$\hat n\f$ and \f$\vec\xi\f$).  Since the Hough transform is performed on a
  set of spectra with discrete frequencies, a peak on the spectrum appearing at
  \f$\nu\f$  could correspond to any source with a demodulated
   frequency in a certain interval. As a consequence, the location of the sources
   compatible with \f$F_0\f$ and \f$\nu\f$ is not a circle but an annulus with a certain
   width.\\

   Our purpose is to map these annuli on a discrete space. An estimation of the
   average thickness of the annuli  tells us that the vast majority of
    annuli will be very thin, and therefore our algorithm should not be
    optimized for drawing
   thick annuli but for thin ones. Also, the mapping implementation should be one with a uniform
    probability distribution in order to avoid discretization errors.
    In order to remove border effects, we use a biunivocal mapping, which
    requires
    that a pixel in a partial Hough map can belong only to one annulus,
    just touched by one peak of the spectrum. The criteria for the biunivocal mapping
    is that if and only if the center of the pixel is inside the annulus, then the pixel
   will be enhanced.\\

  In order to simplify  (reduce the computational cost of) this task we
  construct look up tables (<tt>lut</tt>) where the  borders of these annuli are
  marked for any possible \f$\nu
   -F_0\f$ value. Since we work on a discrete space these <tt>lut</tt> are
   valid for many \f$F_0\f$ values.\\

 Our goal is the construction of Hough maps. In order to produce them

 Here we provide the necessary routines for their construction and use.\\

 In principle, the subroutines provided are valid for
  any Hough master equation of the form:
   $$ \nu-F_0  =\vec\xi (t) \cdot (\hat n -\hat N )\, ,$$
 where $\nu$ is the measured frequency of the signal at time $t$,
  $F_0$ intrinsic frequency of the signal at that time, $\hat n$ location of the
  souce in the sky, $\hat N$ the center of the sky patch used in the
  demodulation procedure,
   and
  $\vec\xi (t)$ any vector.

  The  form of this vector $\vec\xi (t)$
  depends on the demodulation procedure
   used in the previous  step.  In our case this corresponds to
$$\vec\xi (t) = \left( F_0+
\sum_k F_k \left[ \Delta T  \right]^k\right) \frac{\vec v(t)}{c}
 + \left( \sum_k k F_k \left[ \Delta  T \right]^{k-1}\right)
\frac {\vec x(t)- \vec x(\hat t_0)}{c}\, ,$$
and
   $$F_0 \equiv  f_0 + \sum_k \Delta f_k
 \left[ \Delta T \right]^k \, , $$
 where
 $\vec v(t)$ is the velocity of the detector, $\vec x(t)$ is the detector
 position,
 $ T_{\hat N}(t)$ is the  time  at
 the solar system barycenter (for a given sky
  location $\hat N$),
   $\Delta T \equiv T_{\hat N}(t)-T_{\hat N}(\hat t_0)$,
  $\Delta f_k = f_k-F_k$ the  residual spin-down parameter,
$F_k$ the  spin-down parameter used in the demodulation, and $f_0$, $f_k$ the
intrinsic  frequency and spin-down parameters of the source at time $\hat t_0$.\\

 Looking at the generic Hough master equation, one realizes that
 for a fixed  time, a given value of $F_0$, and a measured frequency $\nu$
  (from a selected peak), the source could be located anywhere on a circle (whose
 center points in the same direction of $\vec\xi (t)$ and is characterized by

 At this point we have already chosen a sky tiling to produce the Hough map  efficiently.
 It consists of changing coordinates so that the center of the   patch is located at
  $(0,-\pi/2)$ in ($\alpha-\delta$) (or in any other coordinate system), then we make
  use
  of the stereographic projection and we take horizontal and vertical lines on
  the projected plane at constant space separation.
  This projection is advantageous because it avoids distortions, i.e. the
pixel size is almost constant independently of the sky location, and makes the
algorithm simpler. The stereographic projection has the property to map circles
on the celestial sphere to circles on the projected plane.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Error conditions}
\vspace{0.1in}
\input{LUTHErrorTable}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Constant declarations}
The initial settings at compile time are the following:\\


\texttt{LINERR     0.001}: Maximum \lq\lq error'',
in terms  of the width of the thinnest annulus, which allows one to
represent/approximate a circle by  a line. \\

\texttt{PIXERR     0.1}: Maximum \lq\lq error'', in terms of
the width of the thinnest annulus,
 which allows one to consider two border equivalents.
It is only relevant for determining the lut frequency range validity.\\


\texttt{PIXELFACTORX  2}: Width of the thinnest annulus in terms of pixels
 (x-direction).\\

\texttt{PIXELFACTORY  2}: Width of the thinnest annulus in terms of pixels
(y-direction).\\

\texttt{VEPI 1.0e-06}: Earth epicycle velocity divided by the light velocity
$c$. TO BE CHANGED DEPENDING ON THE DETECTOR. \\

\texttt{VTOT 1.0e-04}: Earth total velocity divided by $c$. TO BE CHANGED
DEPENDING ON THE DETECTOR. \\

\texttt{SIDEX   (100* PIXELFACTORX)}, \\

\texttt{SIDEY   (100* PIXELFACTORY)}:  The maximun number of pixels in a
given patch is  \texttt{SIDEX}$\times$\texttt{SIDEY}. These numbers should be
integers.
They  come from assuming that: the \lq longitudinal' patch size is $dF*10^6/f_0$,
where $10^6 = c/v_{epicycle}$, the thinnest possible annulus is $dF*10^4/f_0$,
where $10^4 = c/v_{tot}$. Therefore, the ratio (longitudinal patch size)/(width
 thinnest annuli) = 100
 (100 TO BE CHANGED DEPENDING ON THE DETECTOR).\\


{\verb@MAX_N_BINS   150@}: Maximun number of frequency bins that can affect a
patch.\\


{\verb@MAX_N_BORDERS   208@}: Maximun number of borders in a patch.\\

Note several of these constants will be removed in a next release. They are
used only for tiling the sky-patch or as default parameters in the test codes.

#include <lal/PHMD.h>
\endcode

The Hough map is an histogram, thus additive. It can be seen as the sum of several
partial Hough maps constructed using just one periodogram, or equivalently, as
the sum of partial Hough map derivatives (\c phmd) and then integrating the
result.

A  \c phmd can be represented by a set of borders, here called <em>left</em> and \e right.
They indicate the beginning and the end of the annuli.
The position of the so-called left borders should be marked with \f$+1\f$, and
the position of the right borders should be marked with \f$-1\f$ in the \c phmd.
To obtain a partial Hough map, one needs to integrate each row of the \c phmd
from left to right.

The representation of a  \c phmd is simplified by considering
pointers to the borders in a pre-calculated look-up-table, plus some extra information about
their character and edge effects when clipping on a finite patch.

\brief Provides routines to place search meshes for two-dimensional parameter spaces with varying metric.

\heading{Synopsis}
\code
#include <lal/TwoDMesh.h>
\endcode

This header covers routines that lay out a mesh of points on
an 2-dimensional parameter space \f$\{(x,y)\}\f$, placed such that no
point in the space lies further than some maximum proper distance
\f$m_\mathrm{thresh}\f$ from a mesh point.

The intended purpose of these routines is to place a set of ``target''
search points over a parameter space, in order to detect signals with
unknown parameters.  The formalism for defining a proper distance
metric on the parameter space is defined in
\ref FlatMesh_h.  However, whereas the routines under
\ref FlatMesh_h require the metric \f$\mathsf{g}_{ab}\f$ to be constant
over the parameter space, the routines under this header only treat
\f$\mathsf{g}_{ab}\f$ as constant over distances \f$\lesssim m_\mathrm{thresh}\f$.

Since the metric is treated as constant over distances \f$\lesssim
m_\mathrm{thresh}\f$, this distance defines an elliptical contour around
any mesh point.  We define a ``tile'' as a parallelogram inscribed
within the ellipse, with its left and right sides aligned with the \f$y\f$
axis.  This is shown in Fig.\figref{fig_tiling} (a), above.  A ``column''
is a set of tiles of constant horizontal width stacked one on top of
the other, as shown in Fig.\figref{fig_tiling} (b).  As the metric
changes over space, the vertical height and tilt of the tiles in a
column may change, so long as their width remains fixed; we note that
if the tilt changes, the tiles will overlap slightly to ensure
complete coverage.  Finally, the boundary of the parameter space may
extend outside the ``corners'' of the column, crossing the end of a
tile between its centre and its edge, as shown in
Fig.\figref{fig_tiling} (c).  These triangular corners can be covered
with one or more extra overlapping tiles of reduced width.

In a parameter space with constant metric, the tile area is maximized
(and the number of covering tiles minimized) when the column width is
\f$\sqrt{2}\f$ times smaller than the projected horizontal width of the
ellipses.  When the ellipses vary, it is generally best to determine
the column width from the \e narrowest ellipse in a column, to
avoid singular effects when tile widths approach the ellipse widths
and become infinitesimally high.

For the column-placement algorithm to work effectively, we require
that the parameter space be representable as a range
\f$y\in[y_1(x),y_2(x)]\f$ between two single-valued functions defined on a
domain \f$x\in[x_\mathrm{min},x_\mathrm{max}]\f$.  If a desired search
region is too complicated to express this way (e.g.\ it has
disconnected regions, or ``branches'' where a vertical line intersects
the boundary more than twice), then one should divide the region up
into subregions with well-behaved boundary functions and tile these
subregions separately.

This header and its associated modules are placed in the \c pulsar
package because they were originally intended for use in searches over
sky position, but they can be used generically for any two-dimensional
parameter space search where the metric is not too poorly behaved.

    \brief Contains function LALFoldAmplitudes: folds amplitudes into phase bins.

Periodic sources of gravitational radiation will produce measured
strains of the following form:
\f[
c[i] = A(t_i,\vec{\lambda}) \sin[\Phi(t_i,\vec{\lambda})] + n(t_i)
\f]
In this equation \f$c[i]\f$ is the discrete time series output of the
detector (perhaps after some data conditioning, such as being
resampled, narrow banded, or with instrument line noise removed). The
amplitude, \f$A(t_i,\vec{\lambda})\f$, is assumed roughly constant at the
gravity wave source, but is modulated by variation in the detector's
response due to the Earth's motion.  The phase, \f$\Phi(t_i,\vec{\lambda})\f$,
is modulated by both the intrinsic spin down of the source, and the
changes in relative motion between the source and the detector.  This
can be calculated for known pulsars.  The vector \f$\vec{\lambda}\f$ is a
vector of parameters that describe the sky position, etc., of the
source and location, etc., of the detector. Finally, \f$n(t_i)\f$ is the
noise, which also includes any other signals that are not coherent
with the phase \f$\Phi(t_i,\vec{\lambda})\f$.

The folded amplitude is given by
\f[
c_{\rm F} [j] = \sum_{i'}
\left \{ A(t_i,\vec{\lambda})\sin[\Phi(t_i,\vec{\lambda})] + n(t_i) \right \} ,
\f]
where the sum over \f$i'\f$ means sum over all \f$i\f$'s with \f$\Phi\f$ in phase bin \f$j\f$.
If the bin sizes are sufficiently small, then \f$c_{\rm F} [j]\f$ can be approximated as
\f[
c_{\rm F} [j] = \sin\Phi_j\sum_{i'} A(t_i,\vec{\lambda}) + \sum_{i'} n(t_i) ,
\f]
where \f$\Phi_j\f$ is representive of the phase for bin \f$j\f$ (e.g., the
phase corresponding to the midpoint of the bin). However, because of
amplitude modulation, the amplitudes that are added to a phase bin are
not guaranteed to enter with the same sign.  Thus, some sort of
amplitude demodulation should be done.

If we demodulate \f$A(t_i,\vec{\lambda})\f$ (for example, in a minimum way
such as multiplying by the sign of the response function) we multiply
each element of the vector \f$c[i]\f$ by an amplitude demodulation factor
\f$D(t_i)\f$
\f[
c_{\rm D\, , F} [j] = \sin\Phi_j \sum_{i'} D(t_i) A(t_i,\vec{\lambda}) + \sum_{i'} D(t_i) n(t_i) ,
\f]
If the average value of \f$D(t_i)\f$ is zero, and is not correlated with the noise, then
\f[
\sum_{i'} D(t_i) n(t_i) \approx 0
\f]
However, the average value of \f$D(t_i)\f$ is probably not zero.
The following is a very preliminary suggestion of how to further reduce the noise.
Consider folding the measured strains, \f$c[i]\f$, again, but this time
shifting the phase bins by \f$\pi\f$.  Define this phase shifted folded
amplitude as:
\f[
c_{\pi, \, \rm D\, , F} [j] = \sin(\Phi_j + \pi) \sum_{i''} D(t_i) A(t_i,\vec{\lambda}) + \sum_{i''} D(t_i) n(t_i) ,
\f]
where the sum over \f$i''\f$ means sum over all \f$i\f$'s with \f$\Phi + \pi\f$ in
phase bin \f$j\f$. This will reverse the sign of the sum of the amplitudes
that enter into each phase bin, but the sum of the noise contributions
into each bin should be roughly the same. If the signal we are
searching for is present, then amplitudes, \f$A(t_i,\vec{\lambda})\f$ are
correlated with \f$D(t_i)\f$ such that
\f[
\sum_{i'} D(t_i) A(t_i,\vec{\lambda}) \approx \bar{A} = {\rm constant}
\f]
Thus,
\f[
c_{\rm D\, , F} [j] - c_{\pi, \, \rm D\, , F} [j] \approx 2 \bar{A}\sin\Phi_j ,
\f]
plus residual noise.  In practice, one needs to fold the amplitudes
only once, and then make the replacement
\f[
c_{\rm D\, , F} [j] \rightarrow c_{\rm D\, , F} [j] - c_{\rm D\, , F} [(j + N/2) \, \% \, j] ,
\f]
where \f$N\f$ is the number of phase bins.  We can then statistically
analyze the hypothesis that the demodulated folded amplitudes
correspond to a sinusoid.

/** \defgroup pulsarCoherent Coherent search routines
    \ingroup pulsarTODO
    \brief This package provides routines to perform a demodulation on a set of data.

In particular, this routine works with frequency domain data by combining
short timescale Fourier Transforms (SFTs) into longer time baseline
demodulated Fourier Transforms (DeFTs). If the assumptions under which the
method was developed are met \ref Williams1999, then the demodulation
procedure concentrates the total power (within \f$5\%-10\%\f$) in a single
frequency bin. In practice, due to the discretization of frequency space, this
power may be shared between two neighbouring bins.

The procedure follows that outlined in \ref Williams1999 and is part of the
continuous-wave search algorithm outlined in \ref Schutz1999.  Briefly, the
routine takes input SFTs, corrects for modulation effects due to intrinsic
frequency spindown and Earth's motion, and outputs a DeFT of long time
baseline. In general the routine can be easily adapted to correct for an
arbitrary modulation effect simply by the use of a suitable timing routine,
here <tt>tdb()</tt>.

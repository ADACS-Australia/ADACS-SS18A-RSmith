.SH NAME
lalfr-print -- prints channel data from frame files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lalfr-print
[\fIfile\fP ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBlalfr-print\fP utility reads the contents of the channels from
each \fIfile\fP and prints the data to the standard output.
If \fIfile\fP is a single dash (`\fB-\fP') or absent,
\fBlalfr-print\fP reads from the standard input.

For each channel contained in \fIfile\fP, the output is written in
two-column format where the first column is the GPS time of each sample
and the second column contains the corresponding sample values.  The columns
are separated by a tab character (``\\t'') and each line is separated by a
newline character (``\\n'').

Each channel in \fIfile\fP is written sequentially and are separated by a line
containing a separator consisting of the character ``#'' followed by the name
of the next channel to be written.
If more than one file argument is present then the separate files are
processed sequentially and separated in the output by a line containing
the separator ``==> \fIfile\fP <=='' where \fIfile\fP is the name of the
current file being processed.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The command:
.PP
.RS
lalfr-print file.gwf
.RE
.PP
prints to standard output all the channels contained in \fIfile.gwf\fP.  If
there are more than one channel present in that file, they can be split into
separate files, each containing a single channel's data, with the command:
.PP
.RS
lalfr-print file.gwf | split -p '#' 
.RE
.PP
and the resulting files ``xaa'', ``xab'', etc., contain the data from each
of the channels in \fIfile.gwf\fP.

.SH NAME
lalfr-fmt -- formats multicolumn text files into channels in a frame file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lalfr-fmt
[\fIfile\fP ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBlalfr-fmt\fP utility reads each multicolumn input file \fIfile\fP
and formats the columns into different channels that are output as a
frame file to the standard output.  The \fIfile\fP operands are processed in
command-line order.  If \fIfile\fP is a single dash (`\fB-\fP') or absent,
\fBlalfr-fmt\fP reads from the standard input.

If \fIfile\fP contains only one column of data, each row is interpreted as a
sample of a single channel having a sample rate of 16384 Hz.  If there
are more than one column in \fIfile\fP then the first column is interpreted
as the GPS time of each sample.  The remaining columns then describe the
samples for separate channels.  The output channels are named ``C01'',
``C02'', etc.

If the first line of \fIfile\fP begins with the `\fB#\fP' character followed
tab-separated list of column names with units in parentheses then these are
used for the channel names and the sample units.

.PP
The command:
.PP
.RS
.HP
seq 0 0.02 99.98 | paste - - - - - | lalfr-fmt > file.gwf
.RE
.PP
produces a frame file \fIfile.gwf\fP containing four channels named
C01, C02, C03, and C04, each with a sample rate of 10 Hz.
